However, an imbalance may exist among different degradation states, because of the specific data size and/or the interest of the practitioners on the different degradation states. Specifically, reliable equipment may experience long periods in low-level degradation states and small times in high-level ones. Then, the conventional trained models may result in overfitting the low-level degradation states, as their data sizes overwhelm the high-level degradation states. In practice, it is usually more interesting to have accurate results on the high-level degradation states, as they are closer to the equipment failure. Thus, during the training of a data-driven model, larger error costs should be assigned to data points with high-level degradation states when the training objective minimizes the total costs on the training dataset. In this paper, an efficient method is proposed for calculating the costs for continuous degradation data.

For predictive maintenance, multi-step-ahead prediction is of interest for projecting the evolution of the future conditions of the equipment of interest, computing the remaining useful life and taking corresponding maintenance decisions. Recursive prediction is one of the popular strategies for multi-step-ahead prediction. SVM is a popular data-driven approach that has been used for recursive multi-step-ahead prediction. Tuning the hyperparameters in SVM during the training process is challenging, and normally the hyperparameters are tuned by solving an optimization problem. This paper analyses the possible objectives of the optimization for tuning hyperparameters. Through experiments on one synthetic dataset and two real time series data, related to the prediction of wind speed in a region and leakage from the reactor coolant pump in a nuclear power plant, a bi-objective optimization combining mean absolute derivatives and accuracy on all prediction steps is shown to be the best choice for tuning SVM hyperparameters for recursive multi-step-ahead prediction.",Bi-objective optimization | Hyperparameters tuning | Recursive multi-step-ahead prediction | Single-objective optimization | Support vector machine,32,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The assessment is, then, formulated as a classification problem, solved by a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) constructed based on a set of training data, whose trustworthiness is given by experts.

This article presents a general framework for the assessment of power system vulnerability to malicious attacks. The concept of susceptibility to an attack is employed to quantitatively evaluate the degree of exposure of the system and its components to intentional offensive actions. A scenario with two agents having opposing objectives is proposed, i.e., a defender having multiple alternatives of protection strategies for system elements, and an attacker having multiple alternatives of attack strategies against different combinations of system elements. The defender aims to minimize the system susceptibility to the attack, subject to budget constraints; on the other hand, the attacker aims to maximize the susceptibility. The problem is defined as a zero-sum game between the defender and the attacker. The assumption that the interests of the attacker and the defender are opposite makes it irrelevant whether or not the defender shows the strategy he/she will use. Thus, the approaches “leader–follower game” or “simultaneous game” do not provide differences as far as the results are concerned. The results show an example of such a situation, and the von Neumann theorem is applied to find the (mixed) equilibrium strategies of the attacker and of the defender.",Intentional attacks | power systems | susceptibility | vulnerability | zero-sum game,9,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Then, interactions among failure mechanisms are modeled as a combination of three basic relations, competition, superposition and coupling. This is the reason why the method is referred to as “compositional method”. Finally, the PoF models and the interaction model are combined to develop a deterministic model of the dependent failure behavior.

This problem is formulated within a combinatorial multiobjective optimization framework and tackled by evolutionary algorithms. Two different models of increasing complexity are used to simulate cascading failures in a network and quantify its resilience: A complex network model [namely, the Motter-Lai (ML) model] and a more detailed and computationally demanding power flow model [namely, the ORNL-Pserc-Alaska (OPA) model]. Both models are tested and compared in a case study involving the 400-kV French power transmission network. The results show that cascade-resilient networks tend to have a nonlinear capacity-load relation: In particular, heavily loaded components have smaller unoccupied portions of capacity, whereas lightly loaded links present larger unoccupied portions of capacity (which is in contrast with the linear capacity-load relation hypothesized in previous works of literature). Most importantly, the optimal solutions obtained using the ML and OPA models exhibit consistent characteristics in terms of phrase transitions in the Pareto fronts and link capacity allocation patterns.

In this paper, we address this issue and apply the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method to constant stress ADT. For illustration, stress relaxation ADT data are analyzed. We also make a simulation study to compare the s-credibility intervals for single model and BMA. The results show that degradation model uncertainty has significant effects on the p-quantile lifetime at the use conditions, especially for extreme quantiles.

When the equipment experiences variable operating conditions, individual data-driven prognostic models are not able to accurately predict the remaining useful life during the entire equipment life. The objective of this work is to develop an ensemble approach of different prognostic models for aggregating their remaining useful life predictions in an adaptive way, for good performance throughout the degradation progression. Two data-driven prognostic models are considered, a homogeneous discrete-time finite-state semi-Markov model and a fuzzy similarity-based model. The ensemble approach is based on a locally weighted strategy that aggregates the outcomes of the two prognostic models of the ensemble by assigning to each model a weight and a bias related to its local performance, that is, the accuracy in predicting the remaining useful life of patterns of a validation set similar to the one under study. The proposed approach is applied to a case study regarding a heterogeneous fleet of aluminum electrolytic capacitors used in electric vehicle powertrains.

MDCFPs have been well studied in literature and various models have been developed to predict the reliability of MDCFPs. In practice, however, due to the limited resource, it is often hard to estimate the precise values of the parameters in the MDCFP model. Hence, the predicted reliability is affected by epistemic uncertainty. Probability box (P-box) is applied in this paper to describe the effect of epistemic uncertainty on MDCFP models. A dimension-reduced sequential quadratic programming (DRSQP) method is developed for the construction of P-box. A comparison to the conventional construction method shows that DRSQP method reduces the computational costs required for P-box constructions. Since epistemic uncertainty reflects the unsureness in the predicted reliability, a decision maker might want to reduce it by investing resource to more accurately estimate the value of each model parameter. A two-stage optimization framework is developed to allocate the resource among the parameters and ensure that epistemic uncertainty is reduced in a most efficient way. Finally, the developed methods are applied on a real case study, a spool valve, to demonstrate their validity.",Epistemic uncertainty | Multiple dependent competing failure process | Reliability box | Reliability modeling | SQP method,34,0,repositoryam,Green,,61573043,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Resilience is defined in this work as the capacity of a system to absorb the impacts of perturbations and recover quickly from disruptive states. It is seen as a property of the system, which depends on a number of design, operation, and control parameters. Within this framework, we introduce the concept of resilience regions in the parameters space: as long as the parameters values remain inside these regions during operation, the system visits only recoverable states or, in other words, it maintains nominal operation or recovers quickly to it. Based on this concept, we perform a resilience analysis of two interconnected critical infrastructures, a gas network and an electric power system. The analysis is performed by numerical calculation of the resilience conditions in terms of design, operation, and control parameters values for given failure scenarios. To render computationally feasible analysis, we resort to an abstract representation of the system dynamics by a linear model of switching dynamics. Although the high-level modeling adopted may suffer from predictive accuracy, the proposed framework can still provide valuable insights in the analysis of system resilience and its dependence on the design, operation, and control parameters under different failure scenarios, which can be valuable to inform the decision making process of CIs operators and other stakeholders.",,37,0,,,,undefined,

Among these methods, dynamic uncertain causality graph (DUCG) has been proved effective in many practical cases. However, the causal graph construction behind the DUCG is complicate and, in many cases, results redundant on the symptoms needed to correctly classify the fault. In this paper, we propose a method to simplify causal graph construction in an automatic way. The method consists in transforming the expert knowledge-based DCUG into a fuzzy decision tree (FDT) by extracting from the DUCG a fuzzy rule base that resumes the used symptoms at the basis of the FDT. Genetic algorithm (GA) is, then, used for the optimization of the FDT, by performing a wrapper search around the FDT: the set of symptoms selected during the iterative search are taken as the best set of symptoms for the diagnosis of the faults that can occur in the system. The effectiveness of the approach is shown with respect to a DUCG model initially built to diagnose 23 faults originally using 262 symptoms of Unit-1 in the Ningde NPP of the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corporation. The results show that the FDT, with GA-optimized symptoms and diagnosis strategy, can drive the construction of DUCG and lower the computational burden without loss of accuracy in diagnosis.",Classification | Dynamic uncertain causality graph | Fault diagnosis | Fuzzy decision tree | Genetic algorithm | Nuclear power plant,16,0,,,,undefined,

In this article, a four-layer, top-down, hierarchical decision-making framework is proposed to assess the prediction capability of prognostic methods. In the framework, prediction capability is broken down into two criteria (Layer 2), six sub-criteria (Layer 3) and 19 basic sub-criteria (Layer 4). Based on the hierarchical framework, a bottom-up, quantitative approach is developed for the assessment of the prediction capability, using the information and data collected at the Layer-4 basic sub-criteria level. Analytical hierarchical process is applied for the evaluation and aggregation of the sub-criteria and support vector machine is applied to develop a classification-based approach for prediction capability assessment.

To this aim, the classical simulation-based Monte Carlo (MC) approaches may be impractical, due to the fact that (i) power networks typically have very large reliabilities, so that cascading failures are rare events and (ii) very large computational expenses are required for the resolution of the cascading failure dynamics of real grids.

In this work, we compare two direct RUL prediction approaches one based on Back Propagation-Artificial Neural Networks (BP-ANN) and the other one on Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). The two approaches are compared on data from turbofan engines. We consider different prognostic metrics such as RMSE, Accuracy Index, Steadiness Index, a-I metric and the time necessary to train and execute the model.

Estimated frequencies of LOCA as a function of break size are used in a variety of regulatory applications and for the Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). Traditionally, two approaches have been used to assess LOCA frequencies as a function of pipe break size: estimates based on statistical analysis of field data collected from piping systems service experience and Probabilistic Fracture Mechanics (PFM) analysis of specific, postulated, physical damage mechanisms. However, due to the high reliability of NPP piping systems, it is difficult to construct a comprehensive service database based on which perform statistical analysis. On the other hand, it is difficult to utilize PFM models for calculating LOCA frequencies because many of the input variables and model assumptions are over-simplified and may not adequately represent the true plant conditions. We overcome these challenges and propose a size- and location-dependent LOCA initiating event frequencies estimation by resorting to the novel MSPM modeling scheme.

In CPSs, cyber and physical processes are dependent and interact with each other: sensors, actuators, communication and computational units are all interconnected to realize functionalities of real-time monitoring, dynamic control and decision support, for normal operation as well as in case of accidents. However, an emerging concern is that the use of computer-based technologies might increase the exposure to failures and accidents, providing new channels for their initiation and propagation. System integrity can be, indeed, affected by hardware component failures, human errors, communication malfunctions and software errors, but also compromised by security breaches and cyber attacks. In practice, these latter could be confused with random components failures on-demand and malfunctions, misjudging their actual nature of malicious cyber attacks and, thus, leading to wrong counteractions. In this study, we analyze and model stochastic failures in components of CPSs, with the purpose of estimating reference values of failure on-demand probabilities and malfunction rates. Considering these as true values, then, significant difference with statistical estimates from field data collected on the real CPS can be used to detect malicious attempts at altering the safety of a NPP.

The necessary consideration of failure events timing and sequencing along the scenarios requires the number of scenarios to be generated to increase with respect to conventional PSA. Consequently, their postprocessing for retrieving safety relevant information regarding the system behavior is challenged because of the large amount of generated scenarios that makes the computational cost for scenario postprocessing enormous and the retrieved information difficult to interpret. In the context of IDPSA, the interpretation consists in the classification of the generated scenarios as safe, failed, Near Misses (NMs), and Prime Implicants (PIs). To address this issue, in this paper we propose the use of an ensemble of Semi-Supervised Self-Organizing Maps (SSSOMs) whose outcomes are combined by a locally weighted aggregation according to two strategies: a locally weighted aggregation and a decision tree based aggregation. In the former, we resort to the Local Fusion (LF) principle for accounting the classification reliability of the different SSSOM classifiers, whereas in the latter we build a classification scheme to select the appropriate classifier (or ensemble of classifiers), for the type of scenario to be classified.

We conceptualize the business continuity management (BCM) process as the integration of four active stages: prevention, mitigation, emergency and recovery. Integrated assessment and management is needed on all stages. On the contrary, the current approaches of BCM have not considered all phases in an integrated manner. We propose a new framework, which stands on an extension of the Bow-Tie model, to efficiently and effectively prevent and mitigate the potential consequences of an accident by properly designing and strengthening safety barriers for preventing and mitigating accidents, and making safety decisions for emergency and recovery. The proposed framework allows considering safety barriers and decisions in an integrated way. For operationalization, we explore the use of two complementary quantitative methods, Bayesian Network (BN) and Constraint Goal Method (CGM). BN takes the “negative” viewpoint of failure to determine the causes which lead to the final damage. CGM employs the positive perspective of the goal achievement process.

To address it, risk analysts often rely on Bow Tie diagrams, which are useful to model the system accident scenarios and appreciate the effects of safety barriers that prevent and mitigate the associated risks. However, the current approach to safety barrier selection and positioning is mainly based on what-if analyses, through which the analysts, based on their experience, add barriers throughout the Bow Tie diagram until the risk of severe accident decreases beyond the given threshold. This way, the set (i.e., portfolio) of barriers finally installed may be not cost-efficient. To overcome this limitation, in this paper we frame the barrier selection issue within the Portfolio Decision Analysis: the goal is supporting the decision maker to identify the portfolios of safety barriers for a given Bow Tie scheme, which are optimal with respect to system residual risk, reliability and investment costs, also accounting for budget limitations and barrier feasibility constraints. The optimization algorithm used to find the optimal portfolios is based on implicit enumeration, which keeps small the computational burden in case of a limited number of alternative safety barriers.

Business Continuity Management (BCM) is a way to integrate the recovery process within the preventive framework of risk assessment. Such integrated risk management strategy offers great potential benefits. However, the complexity of applying it in practice is such that existing BCM strategies are mainly based on qualitative methods only, which limits the potential added values. To support quantitative BCM, in this paper we define a set of quantitative business continuity metrics. The defined metrics are based on the estimated losses incurred by the disruptive event in the whole business process. For this, the business process is divided into four sequential phases, i.e., protection phase, mitigation phase, emergency phase and recovery phase. For each phase, a specific modeling method is developed and an integrated modeling framework is constructed for the business continuity. Simulation can, then, be used to quantify the business continuity metrics.

In this complex context, one of the major concerns is that related to the potentially catastrophic consequences of cascading failures triggered by rare and difficult to predict extreme weather events. In this work, we originally propose to combine an extreme weather stochastic model of literature to a realistic cascading failure simulator based on a direct current (DC) power flow approximation and a proportional re-dispatch strategy. The description of the dynamics of the network is completed by the introduction of a novel restoration model accounting for the operating conditions that a repair crew may encounter during an extreme weather event. The resulting model is solved by a customized sequential Monte Carlo scheme in order to quantify the impact of extreme weather events on the reliability/availability performances of the power grid.

An empirical classification model is developed, based on the Majority Rule Sorting method, to evaluate the class of criticality of the plant/system of interest, with respect to safety. The model is built on the basis of a (limited-size) set of data representing the characteristics of a number of plants and their corresponding criticality classes, as assigned by experts. The construction of the classification model may raise two issues. First, the classification examples provided by the experts may contain contradictions: a validation of the consistency of the considered dataset is, thus, required. Second, uncertainty affects the process: a quantitative assessment of the performance of the classification model is, thus, in order, in terms of accuracy and confidence in the class assignments. In this paper, two approaches are proposed to tackle the first issue: the inconsistencies in the data examples are “resolved” by deleting or relaxing, respectively, some constraints in the model construction process. Three methods are proposed to address the second issue: (i) a model retrieval-based approach, (ii) the Bootstrap method and (iii) the cross-validation technique.

Including these additional features within an overarching framework can render the analysis infeasible in practical cases, due to the high dimension of the system state-space and the computational effort correspondingly needed to explore the possible system evolutions in search of the interesting (and very rare) ones of failure. To tackle this hurdle, in this article we introduce a framework for efficiently probing the space of event sequences of a dynamic system by means of a guided Monte Carlo simulation. Such framework is semi-automatic and allows embedding the analyst's prior knowledge about the system and his/her objectives of analysis. Specifically, the framework allows adaptively and intelligently allocating the simulation efforts preferably on those sequences leading to outcomes of interest for the objectives of the analysis, e.g., typically those that are more safety-critical (and/or rare). The emerging diversification in the filling of the state-space by the preference-guided exploration allows also the retrieval of critical system features, which can be useful to analysts and designers for taking appropriate means of prevention and mitigation of dangerous and/or unexpected consequences.

Unacceptable computational burden with large datasets and difficulty in tuning hyperparameters are usually the drawbacks of kernel methods. In order to reduce the computational burden, this paper presents a modified version of the Feature Vector Selection (FVS) method, proposing an approximation of the estimate function as a weighted sum of the predicted values of the Feature Vectors (FVs), where the weights are computed as the oblique projections of the new data points on the FVs in the feature space. Such approximation is, then, obtained by optimizing only the predicted values of the FVs. By defining a least square error optimization problem with equal constraints, analytic solutions of the predicted values of the FVs can be obtained. The proposed method is named Feature Vector Regression (FVR). The tuning of hyperparameters in FVR is also explained in the paper and shown to be less complicated than for other kernel methods. Comparisons with some other popular kernel methods for regression on several public datasets show that FVR, with a small subset of the training dataset (i.e. selected FVs), gives results comparable with those of the methods which give best results in terms of the prediction accuracy. The main contribution of this paper is the new kernel method (i.e. FVR), capable of achieving satisfactory results with reduced efforts because of the small number of hyperparameters to be tuned and the reduced training dataset size used.",Computational complexity | Feature Vector Regression | Feature vector selection | Hyperparameters tuning | Kernel method | Prediction | Regression,9,0,,,,undefined,

On the DG systems side, we consider the inherent uncertainties of renewable energy sources, loads and energy prices. We develop a Monte Carlo simulation-optimal power flow (MCS-OPF) computational framework that is capable of generating consecutive time-dependent operating scenarios of the integrated system. Quantitative analysis is carried out to measure the impact of communication networks degradation onto the DG systems. For illustration, the framework is applied to a modified IEEE 13 nodes test feeder.

A main difficulty is that the fleet of equipment typically experiences different operating conditions, which influence both the condition monitoring data and the degradation processes that physically determine the RUL. We propose an approach for RUL estimation from heterogeneous fleet data based on three phases: firstly, the degradation levels (states) of an homogeneous discrete-time finite-state semi-markov model are identified by resorting to an unsupervised ensemble clustering approach. Then, the parameters of the discrete Weibull distributions describing the transitions among the states and their uncertainties are inferred by resorting to the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method and to the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), respectively. Finally, the inferred degradation model is used to estimate the RUL of fleet equipment by direct Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The proposed approach is applied to two case studies regarding heterogeneous fleets of aluminium electrolytic capacitors and turbofan engines. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting the RUL and its superiority compared to a fuzzy similarity-based approach of literature.",Aluminium electrolytic capacitors | Failure prognostics | Heterogeneous fleet | Homogeneous discrete-time finite-state semi-markov model | Remaining Useful Life (RUL) | Turbofan engines,60,0,repositoryam,Green,EC,71231001,European Commission

In this case, it is necessary to quantify and control the uncertainties in the analysis, which affect the estimated safety margins. This can be achieved by Sensitivity Analysis (SA) and Uncertainty Analysis (UA) techniques tailored to handle the large computational costs of TH codes. This work presents an Ensemble-Based Sensitivity Analysis (EBSA) based on Finite Mixture Model (FMM) as an effective solution to keep low the code runs and handle the uncertainty in the SA methods. The approach proposed is challenged against a situation of a very low number of code runs: the Bootstrap method is, then, used in support. Three different strategies based on EBSA and Bootstrap are set forth (i.e., bottom-up, all-out and filter strategies).

The key issue for high prediction accuracy is the selection of SVR parameters, which is essentially an optimization problem. As one of the most effective evolutionary optimization methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been successfully applied to tune SVR parameters and is shown to perform well. However, the inherent drawbacks of PSO, including slow convergence and local optima, have hindered its further application in practical reliability prediction problems. To overcome these drawbacks, many improvement strategies are being developed on the mechanisms of PSO, whereas there is little research exploring a priori information about historical data to improve the PSO performance in the SVR parameter selection task. In this paper, a novel method controlling the inertial weight of PSO is proposed to accelerate its convergence and guide the evolution out of local optima, by utilizing the analytical selection (AS) method based on a priori knowledge about SVR parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed ASPSO method is almost as accurate as the traditional PSO and outperforms it in convergence speed and ability in tuning SVR parameters.

Two tolerance parameters are introduced in the approach to control the computational complexity, reduce the influence of the intrinsic noise in the data and avoid the overfitting problem of SVR.

In addition, the adoption of the bio-inspired concept of IS makes EIP evolve from classical engineered systems towards complex engineered systems, with associated static and dynamic complexity characteristics.

It is pointed out that a qualified reliability metric that is able to consider the effect of epistemic uncertainty needs to (1) compensate the conservatism in the estimations of the component-level reliability metrics caused by epistemic uncertainty, and (2) satisfy the duality axiom, otherwise it might lead to paradoxical and confusing results in engineering applications.

One way toward an integrated approach is that of adopting exergy analysis for assessing efficiency and test improving design and operation solutions. The paper presents an exergy based analysis for improving efficiency and safety of energy systems, named Thermorisk analysis. The purpose of the Thermorisk analysis is to supply information to control, and eventually reduce, the risk of the systems (i.e. risk of accidents) by acting on the thermodynamic parameters and safety characteristics in the same frame. The proper combination of exergy and risk analysis allows monitoring the effects of efficiency improvement on the safety of the systems analyzed.

This is done by resorting to a Best-Estimate (BE) Thermal-Hydraulic (TH) code, whose outcomes are compared to given safety thresholds enforced by regulation. This allows identifying the limit-state function that separates the failure domain from the safe domain. In practice, the TH model response is affected by uncertainties (both epistemic and aleatory), which make the limit-state function and the failure domain probabilistic. The present paper sets forth an innovative approach to identify the failure domain together with the safest plant operating conditions. The approach relies on the use of Reduced Order Models (ROMs) and K-D Tree. The model failure boundary is approximated by Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and, then, projected onto the space of the controllable variables (i.e., the model inputs that can be manipulated by the plant operator, such as reactor control-rods position, feed-water flow-rate through the plant primary loops, accumulator water temperature and pressure, repair times, etc.). The farthest point from the failure boundary is, then, computed by means of a K-D Tree-based nearest neighbor algorithm; this point represents the combination of input values corresponding to the safest operating conditions.

The capacitor degradation process, which remarkably depends on the temperature experienced by the component, is typically monitored by observing the capacitor equivalent series resistance (ESR). However, the ESR measurement is influenced by the temperature at which the measurement is performed, which changes depending on the operating conditions. To address this problem, we introduce a novel degradation indicator independent from the measurement temperature.

We propose a diagnostic model based on the COMPacted Object Sample Extraction (COMPOSE) algorithm, which has been developed in the domain of streaming data learning. The key idea of this algorithm is to learn the concept drift caused by the modification of the working conditions. This is done by i) aggregating the labeled training dataset with unlabeled new data collected in a different working condition, and ii) identifying the data drift trend by performing a shrinkage of the aggregated dataset. In the present work, the original COMPOSE algorithm has been modified by introducing an automatic method for dynamically setting the COMPOSE internal parameters, taking into account the characteristics of the new collected data. The overall method has been verified with respect to the Case Western Reserve University Bearing dataset, considering the classification of bearing defects in an evolving environment characterized by modification of the motor load. The obtained performance is satisfactory: bearing defects at different motor loads from that considered for training the diagnostic model are classified with good accuracy.

The advantages of shorter sea routes and hydrocarbon energy exploitation have recently led to increased marine activities in such harsh environments. Nevertheless, the risks therein need to be systematically identified and assessed. Specifically, the potential consequences of major incidents in Arctic waters should be studied. However, research in this domain is scarce, mainly due to the lack of knowledge and information related to the Arctic marine transportation system (AMTS). In this paper, we present an event tree analysis (ETA) model to illustrate the possible accident scenarios and calculate the probabilities for the associated consequences of ship stuck in ice in Arctic waters. The probability of occurrence of the initiating event and intermediate events in the scenarios are extracted by experts' elicitation and, then, the probabilities of the potential outcome events are computed from the ETA model. Fuzzy set theory is incorporated into the ETA model to handle the epistemic uncertainties in the probability values.",,6,0,,,,undefined,

As for any energy equipment, reliability is the fundamental attribute that needs to be guaranteed. A number of studies have been carried out for wind turbine reliability assessment. Most of them model the wind turbine system as a whole, without investigating its interior structure and failure logic. In this paper, a modeling and simulation framework is proposed for the reliability assessment of generic geared wind turbine systems. It is based on a Goal Tree, Success Tree and Master Logic Diagram for modeling the relationships among components and functions in a wind turbine system, and the impact of factors and mechanisms influencing the failure of the components. The modeling framework is customized to represent the strength of the relationships and the uncertainty of the impact of failures of these components on other components and functions. The model is eventually integrated in a Monte Carlo simulation framework for the computation of the wind turbine system reliability. Finally, model validation is performed by comparing the simulation results with those obtained by a Bayesian network model developed for this purpose. •We propose a reliability model and simulation framework for wind turbine system.•We consider the logic relationships among different components in the system.•The GTST-MLD approach is used to develop the model for reliability evaluation.•A simulation framework is developed for the quantification of the model.•The proposed framework is validated by comparing with Bayesian network modeling.",Goal tree | Master logic diagram | Monte carlo simulation | Reliability | Success tree | Wind turbine,45,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In this new view, a network failure can be regarded as a percolation process and the critical threshold of percolation can be used as network failure criterion linked to the operational settings under control. To demonstrate our approach, we consider both random network models and real networks with different nodes and/or edges lifetime distributions. We study numerically and theoretically the network reliability and find that the network reliability can be solved as a voting system with threshold given by percolation theory. Then we find that the average lifetime of random network increases linearly with the average lifetime of its nodes with uniform life distributions. Furthermore, the average lifetime of the network becomes saturated when system size is increased. Finally, we demonstrate our method on the transmission network system of IEEE 14 bus.",Criticality | Network reliability | Percolation theory | Phase transition | Random network,106,1,repositoryvor,Green,NSFC,289447,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The methodology is founded on a feature extraction procedure, which feeds a spectral clustering technique, embedding the unsupervised fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm, which evaluates the functional similarity among the different operational/faulty transients. A procedure for validating the plausibility of the obtained clusters is also propounded based on physical considerations.

In this article, we are primarily concerned with power transmission networks and we consider the problem of allocation of generation to distributors by rewiring links under the objectives of maximizing network resilience to cascading failure and minimizing investment costs. The combinatorial multiobjective optimization is carried out by a nondominated sorting binary differential evolution (NSBDE) algorithm. For each generators-distributors connection pattern considered in the NSBDE search, a computationally cheap, topological model of failure cascading in a complex network (named the Motter-Lai [ML] model) is used to simulate and quantify network resilience to cascading failures initiated by targeted attacks. The results on the 400 kV French power transmission network case study show that the proposed method allows us to identify optimal patterns of generators-distributors connection that improve cascading resilience at an acceptable cost. To verify the realistic character of the results obtained by the NSBDE with the embedded ML topological model, a more realistic but also more computationally expensive model of cascading failures is adopted, based on optimal power flow (namely, the ORNL-Pserc-Alaska) model). The consistent results between the two models provide impetus for the use of topological, complex network theory models for analysis and optimization of large infrastructures against cascading failure with the advantages of simplicity, scalability, and low computational cost.",Cascading failures | Complex network theory model | Critical infrastructure | Optimization | Power flow model | Power transmission network,52,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The monitoring system is based on a Self-Organizing Map (SOM), trained considering data collected from healthy IGBTs. An indicator of the IGBT degradation is defined as the distance between the measured SOM input vector, i.e., the signal measured on the monitored IGBT, and its SOM Best Matching Unit (BMU) representative of an healthy IGBT in similar working conditions. Then, a method based on the definition of a utility function for the identification of the threshold value to be used for the classification of the IGBT degradation state is proposed. The approach is verified with respect to experimental data collected from an inverter connected to an electric motor, and is shown able to identify the IGBTs degradation state regardless of the actual operating condition.",,4,0,,,,undefined,

The parameters of this distribution cannot be estimated by applying the widely used Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method when the collected field data contain right-censored times only. To overcome this limitation, the Weibayes method is often used in industrial practice: it consists in setting the value of the shape parameter based on prior knowledge and, then, estimating a lower confidence bound on the scale parameter. An alternative approach to estimate the Weibull parameters relies on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique, within the Bayesian statistics framework. This technique allows accommodating poor information on the parameter values, which is modeled by vague prior distributions.

Several algorithms have been developed for devising optimal control actions to reduce the risks in the event of cascading power system failure. The standard practice is that of resorting to some historical test systems (e.g. IEEE model systems) to test the efficacy of the algorithms; however, this approach does not guarantee the scalability and the robustness of the proposed control strategies with respect to different power grid structures or long term modifications of the existing networks. More recently, randomly generated artificial networks have been exploited for investigating the vulnerability and the resilience of power networks to cascading failures, but, typically, the distributions employed could not capture most of the realistic features of a power transmission grid, especially the electrical ones. In this work, we apply an algorithm recently proposed in literature for generating random power grid topologies with realistic electrical parameters and we extend it to include random distributions of both generators and loads. The combination of the sampling algorithm with the realistic cascade simulation tool allows performing statistical analyses on different families of power grids with respect to their cascading failure behavior, thus offering a powerful tool for identifying strengths and weaknesses of given grid classes and, possibly, suggesting improvements for increasing their safety.",,2,0,,,,undefined,

EIP deployment is driven by several potential benefits, i.e., improvement of IAs operational performance (increase of end product output), improvement of IAs economic indicators (increase of revenues) and decrease of IAs exposure to external risks (leading to energy/material supply shutdowns). However, gain of these benefits depend on IAs internal and operational conditions, and other factors. Then, the opportunity of EIP deployment must be evaluated, going through the description of these conditions and factors, and the modelling of their influence on the potential benefits, in order to arrive at optimal choices of deployment. In practice, several uncertainties exist in both the description of conditions and factors, and in the modelling of their impact on the EIP.

The computational effort associated to this approach can be prohibitive because of the large number of lengthy T-H code simulations necessary for the accurate and precise quantification of the (typically small) failure probability. To overcome this issue, in the present paper we propose an Adaptive Meta-model-Based Subset Importance Sampling (AM-SIS) approach that originally and efficiently combines the powerful features of several advanced computational methods of literature: in particular, Subset Simulation (SS) and fast-running Artificial Neural Network (ANN) meta-models are coupled within an adaptive MC- based Importance Sampling (IS) scheme. The objective is to construct a fully nonparametric estimator of the ideal, zero-variance Importance Sampling Density (ISD) and iteratively refine it, in such a way that: (i) the accuracy and precision of the corresponding failure probability estimates are improved and (ii) the number of burdensome T-H code runs is reduced, along with the associated computational cost. The method is demonstrated on a case study of an emergency passive decay heat removal system of a Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR).

A comprehensive evaluation of the risk associated with these systems must consider contingencies under normal environmental conditions and also extreme ones. Environmental conditions can strongly influence the operation and performance of distributed generation systems, not only due to the growing shares of renewable-energy generators installed but also for the environment-related contingencies that can damage or deeply degrade the components of the power grid. In this context, the main novelty of this paper is the development of probabilistic risk assessment and risk-cost optimization framework for distributed power generation systems, that take the effects of extreme weather conditions into account. A Monte Carlo non-sequential algorithm is used for generating both normal and severe weather. The probabilistic risk assessment is embedded within a risk-based, bi-objective optimization to find the optimal size of generators distributed on the power grid that minimize both risks and cost associated with severe weather. An application is shown on a case study adapted from the IEEE 13 nodes test system. By comparing the results considering normal environmental conditions and the results considering the effects of extreme weather, the relevance of the latter clearly emerges.",AC power flow | Distributed generation | Extreme weather conditions | Monte Carlo simulation | Probabilistic risk assessment | Weather modelling,83,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In this paper, we propose a novel postprocessing method, which resorts to a risk-based clustering method for identifying Near Misses among the safe scenarios. This is important because the possibility of recovering these combinations of failures within a tolerable grace time allows avoiding deviations to accident and, thus, reducing the downtime (and the risk) of the system. The postprocessing risk-significant features for the clustering are extracted from the following: (i) the probability of a scenario to develop into an accidental scenario, (ii) the severity of the consequences that the developing scenario would cause to the system, and (iii) the combination of (i) and (ii) into the overall risk of the developing scenario. The optimal selection of the extracted features is done by a wrapper approach, whereby a modified binary differential evolution (MBDE) embeds a K -means clustering algorithm. The characteristics of the Near Misses scenarios are identified solving a multiobjective optimization problem, using the Hamming distance as a measure of similarity.

We consider support vector regression (SVR) as solution approach, for its known performance on time series forecasting. However, SVR parameters selection is very critical for obtaining satisfactory forecasting. Currently, two different ways are followed to set the values of SVR parameters. One way is that of choosing parameters based on prior knowledge or experts experience on the problem at hand: this is a simple and quick, practical way but often not optimal in complex situations and for non-expert users. Another way is that of searching the values of the parameters via some intelligent methods of optimization of the SVR regression performance: for doing this efficiently, one must avoid problems like divergence, slow convergence, local optima, etc. In this paper, we propose the combination of an analytic selection (AS) method of prior selection followed by a genetic algorithm (GA) for intelligent optimization. The combination of these two methods allows utilizing the available prior knowledge by AS for guiding the GA optimization process so as to avoid divergence and local optima, and accelerate convergence. To show the effectiveness of the method, some simulation experiments are designed, based on artificial or real reliability datasets.

The comparison shows that a BBN approach should be preferred in all the cases characterized by quantifiable uncertainty in the input (i.e. when probability distributions can be assigned to describe the input parameters uncertainty), since it provides a satisfactory representation of the uncertainty and its output is directly interpretable for use within PSA. On the other hand, in cases characterized by very limited knowledge, an analyst may feel constrained by the probabilistic framework, which requires assigning probability distributions for describing uncertainty. In these cases, the FES seems to lead to a more transparent representation of the input and output uncertainty.",Bayesian belief networks | Dependence assessment | Expert judgement | Expert models | Fuzzy logic | Human reliability analysis,103,0,repositoryam,Green,ENSI,82610,Eidgenössisches Nuklearsicherheitsinspektorat

However, the uncertainties in the operation of these systems are typically larger than for their active counterparts, due to a general imprecise knowledge of the physical phenomena driving their passive functioning and the absence of a well-established and recorded operative practice. Thus, functional failures may arise, which are due to deviations from the modeled, expected behavior of passive safety systems. The quantification of the probabilities of these events is then a fundamental task, which typically requires the propagation of the uncertainties by standard Monte Carlo procedures based on the repeated runs of the computer codes numerically encoding the system model. However, when these failure probabilities are very low and/or the computer codes are computationally intensive, the efficiencies of these methods render the analyses impractical. This work proposes to resort to the modified meta-IS algorithm, previously introduced by the authors, in order to address this issue by the combination of kriging-based metamodel to an MC-based importance sampling strategy. The efficiency of the algorithm is shown with reference to a case study of a natural convection-based cooling system of a gas-cooled fast reactor, operating under a post-loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) and compared to that of other variance reduction-based methods of literature.",Carlo | Functional failures | Importance sampling | Kriging-based metamodeling | Monte | Passive systems | Uncertainties,8,0,,,,undefined,

In this article, we present a novel computational framework for dynamic reliability analysis whose objectives are i) accounting for discrete stochastic transition events and ii) identifying the prime implicants (PIs) of the dynamic system. The framework entails adopting a multiple-valued logic (MVL) to consider stochastic transitions at discretized times. Then, PIs are originally identified by a differential evolution (DE) algorithm that looks for the optimal MVL solution of a covering problem formulated for MVL accident scenarios.

Nevertheless, the predictions provided by SVR are point estimates whereas in order to take better informed decisions, an uncertainty assessment should be also carried out. For this, we apply bootstrap to SVR so as to obtain confidence and prediction intervals, without having to make any assumption about probability distributions and with good performance even when only a small data set is available. The bootstrapped SVR is first verified on Monte Carlo experiments and then is applied to a real case study concerning the prediction of degradation of a component from the offshore oil industry.

However, these calculations may overlook the risk of limit violations due to uncertainties in the operating conditions of the networks. To overcome this limitation, related to both injection and demand profiles, the present paper addresses the problem of DG penetration with a Monte Carlo technique that accounts for the intrinsic variability of electric power consumption. The power absorbed by each load of a medium voltage network is characterized by a load variation curve; a probabilistic load flow is then used for computing the maximum DG power that can be connected to each bus without determining a violation of electric constraints.

However in practice, operating and environmental conditions may change, unexpected and previously unanticipated events may occur and corresponding new anomalous patterns develop. Therefore for practical applications, techniques are required to detect novelties in patterns and give confidence to the user on the validity of the performed diagnosis and predictions. In this paper, the application of two types of novelty detection approaches is compared: a statistical approach based on multivariate kernel density estimation and an approach based on a type of unsupervised artificial neural network, called the growing neural gas (GNG). The comparison is performed on a case study in the field of railway turnout systems. Both approaches demonstrate their suitability for detecting novel patterns.

With the estimation of the failure probability, the replacement is determined by minimizing a decision variable called the expected cost per unit time, which considers both the replacement upon failure and preventive replacement. Simulated experiments are performed with regards to a pneumatic valve, a normally-closed and gas-actuated valve, whose dynamic physical model is studied a lot in recent years.

Therefore, it is opportune to apply different predictive models in the different stages, with the aim of balancing accuracy and calculation complexity in light of the varying needs and constraints of the different stages. This paper proposes a condition-based adaptive trend prediction method for rotating bearings. The empirical mode decomposition-self-organizingmap (EMD-SOM) method is applied to analyze vibration signals and calculate a confidence value (CV) on the bearing health state. Four different degradation stages, normal, slight degradation, severe degradation and failure, are identified by using the CV value and CV change rate. At each stage, we develop a different prediction strategy tailored to the specific degradation profile. In operation, upon recognition of the stage, the corresponding prognostics models are selected to estimate the health trend. A case study on datasets from 17 test bearings demonstrates and validates the feasibility of the proposed method. The experiment results show that the adaptive prediction method is accurate and reduces computational complexity, which can be important for online applications, especially in case of limited computing resources.",Adaptive prediction | Confidence value | Empirical mode decomposition | Rotating bearing degradation | Self-organizing map,103,0,repositoryvor,Green,NSFC,61304111,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The framework searches for the optimal size and location of the distributed renewable generation units (DG). Uncertainties in renewable resources availability, components failure and repair events, loads and grid power supply are incorporated. A Monte Carlo simulation-optimal power flow (MCS-OPF) computational model is used to generate scenarios of the uncertain variables and evaluate the network electric performance with respect to the expected value of the global cost (ECG). The framework is quite general and complete, but at the expenses of large computational times for the analysis of real systems. In this respect, the work of the present paper addresses the issue and introduces a purposely tailored, original technique for reducing the computational efforts of the analysis. The originality of the proposed approach lies in the development of a new search engine for performing the minimization of the ECG, which embeds hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) within a differential evolution (DE) search scheme to identify groups of similar individuals in the DE population and, then, ECG is calculated for selected representative individuals of the groups only, thus reducing the number of objective function evaluations. For exemplification, the framework is applied to a distribution network derived from the IEEE 13 nodes test feeder. The results show that the newly proposed hierarchical clustering differential evolution (HCDE) MCS-OPF framework is effective in finding optimal DG-integrated network configurations with reduced computational efforts. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Differential evolution | Distributed renewable generation | Hierarchical clustering analysis | Optimization | Simulation | Uncertainty,28,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The inputs of the pre-processing module are batches of residuals generated by a combined set of observers that are robust to operating point changes. The outputs of the pre-processing module are the latent residuals which are progressively fed into the decision module, a dynamic weighting ensemble of fault classifiers that incrementally learns the residuals-faults relationships and dynamically classifies the faults including multiple new classes. The pre-processing module consists of the Wold cross-validation algorithm along with the non-linear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS) that projects the residual to the new feature space, extracts the latent information among the residuals and estimates the optimal number of principal components to form the latent residuals.

On the other hand, concerns arise due to the not fully understood physical phenomena underlying their (passive) functioning and the scarce operating experience to characterize them, which can give rise to functional failures due to deviations from their modeled, expected behavior. The estimation of the probabilities of these failures requires the propagation of uncertainties in the passive systems functions models, which can be done by classical, crude Monte Carlo schemes. However, the passive system design is such that failure is a rare event, which renders these approaches often impractical due to the computational efforts involved in the repetition of runs of the computer codes numerically encoding the system model. In order to overcome this problem, in this paper we propose to apply the meta-AK-IS2 algorithm, previously introduced by the authors for obtaining improved computational efficiencies by coupling a kriging-based metamodel to an MC-based importance sampling strategy. The method is developed and demonstrated with reference to a case study of a natural convection-based cooling system of a gas-cooled fast reactor, operating under a post-loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA).

Due to limited data and to uncertainty, classification algorithms are not perfectly accurate in practical applications. Maintenance decisions based on erroneous fault classifications result in inefficient resource allocations and/or operational disturbances. Thus, knowing the accuracy of classifiers is important to give confidence in the maintenance decisions. The average accuracy of a classifier on a test set of data patterns is often used as a measure of confidence in the performance of a specific classifier. However, the performance of a classifier can vary in different regions of the input data space. Several techniques have been proposed to quantify the reliability of a classifier at the level of individual classifications. Many of the proposed techniques are only applicable to specific classifiers, such as ensemble techniques and support vector machines. In this paper, we propose a meta approach based on the typicalness framework (Kolmogorov's concept of randomness), which is independent of the applied classifier. We apply the approach to a case of fault diagnosis in railway turnout systems and compare the results obtained with both extreme learning machines and echo state networks. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.",Confidence estimation | Echo state networks | Extreme learning machines | Railway turnout system | Reliability of classifiers | Typicalness framework,8,0,repositoryam,Green,SNF,205121_147175,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung

A stochastic model was developed to simulate the operations and the line disconnection and reconnection events of the electric network due to overloads beyond the rated capacity. We represent and propagate the uncertainties related to consumption variability, ambient temperature variability, wind speed variability and wind power generation variability. The model is applied to a case study of literature. Conclusions are drawn on the impact that different sources of variability have on the reliability of the network and on the seamless electric power supply. Finally, the analysis enables identifying possible system states, in terms of power request and supply, that are critical for network vulnerability and may induce a cascade of line disconnections leading to massive network blackout. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Line disconnection modeling | Stochastic framework | Uncertainty in renewable energy | Wind energy,54,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The billing function of SEM is one of its most important functions to its operators and end-users. Because the SEM devices need to be highly reliable, in this study we conduct accelerated degradation tests (ADTs) for the prediction of SEM reliability with respect to the billing function. For designing the ADTs, we have identified five key modules and their components, two performance indicators, and three possible degradation stressors. Six ADTs are conducted under different configurations of the stressors. The test data are then used to fit degradation paths by linear regression models. Extrapolation to the failure threshold allows the prediction of the Time-to-Failure of SEM. Finally, the reliable lifetime of the SEM is predicted by an accelerated degradation function which is obtained by fitting a Weibull failure time distribution. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Such resilience property of interconnected systems depends also on their structure and design parameters. In this paper, we abstract the structure of the system by a directed graph. A state dynamics is associated to each of the subsystems, with interdependent terms that can represent different types of interdependencies. The system response to undesired disturbances and events could, then, be analyzed using notions from set theory, to identify regions of operation and recoverable or non-recoverable conditions.

In this paper, we consider two approaches to infrastructure modelling: (1) a simplified (computationally cheap) graph-theoretical (topological) approach based on network theory; and (2) a realistic (computationally intensive) physical approach based on power flow models. The objective of the work is to investigate whether the optimal network obtained using a simplified topological model is also physically optimal when a more realistic power flow model is embraced. This is performed through simulations on the 400kV French power transmission network.

The allocated parameters are typically provided by a physics-based model which has been proved to be inaccurate for some operating conditions. As a consequence, inaccuracies are introduced in the evaluation of the health indicator, undermining the possibility of using it for prognostics. In this paper, we overcome this hurdle by resorting to hybrid modelling which integrates the physics-based model into an ensemble of data-driven models built using Kernel Regression (KR) methods. A local procedure which uses the historical performance of the physical and data-driven models is adopted to aggregate the different model outcomes.

A Monte Carlo simulation - optimal power flow (MCS-OPF) computational model is used to generate scenarios of the uncertain variables and evaluate the network electric performance. As a response to the need of monitoring and controlling the risk associated to the performance of the optimal DG-integrated network, we introduce the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measure into the framework. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is done with respect to the minimization of the expectations of the global cost (C g) and energy not supplied (ENS) combined with their respective CVaR values. The multi-objective optimization is performed by the fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm NSGA-II. For exemplification, the framework is applied to a distribution network derived from the IEEE 13 nodes test feeder. The results show that the MOO MCS-OPF framework is effective in finding an optimal DG-integrated network considering multiple sources of uncertainties. In addition, from the perspective of decision making, introducing the CVaR as a measure of risk enables the evaluation of trade-offs between optimal expected performances and risks. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Conditional value-at-risk | Distributed renewable generation | Genetic algorithm | Multi-objective optimization | Simulation | Uncertainty,69,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The impacts of component failures on these types of systems can significantly affect technical and operational reliability. Therefore, many advanced railway systems and components are equipped with monitoring and diagnostic tools to improve reliability and reduce maintenance expenditures. Approaches to predict component failure and remaining useful life are usually based on continuously measured data. The use of event data is limited, especially for predicting failures in railway systems. In this paper, we apply Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to predict the occurrence of railway operation disruptions based on discrete-event data. ELM exhibit a good generalization ability, are computationally very efficient and do not require tuning of network parameters. For exemplification purposes, a case study with real data is considered concerning failures that cause undemanded service brake application of railway vehicles. While other machine learning techniques, such as multilayer perceptrons and feedforward neural networks with learning based on genetic algorithms, were not able to extract patterns in the diagnostic event data, the proposed approach was capable of predicting 98% of the operation disruption events correctly. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,4,0,,,,undefined,

On top of the inherent uncertainty in wind speed, it is necessary to account also for the uncertainty in the relationship between wind speed and the corresponding power production, typically described by a power curve whose characteristic parameters are not precisely known in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to wind power forecasting with uncertainty quantification. The approach can be schematized in two steps: first, short-term estimation of wind speed Prediction Intervals (PIs) is performed within a multi-objective optimization framework worked out by Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II); then, the uncertainty in wind speed and the uncertainty in the power curve are combined via a bootstrap sampling technique, thus obtaining wind power PIs with same coverage as the wind speed PIs. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,2,0,,,,undefined,

In such a system of systems, a crucial issue is the understanding of response at failures, which propagate across the system domains and spatially across regional and national borders, resulting in long service outages and severe accident scenarios. In this paper we propose a methodology to analyze the system response at a disturbance. The methodology is based on a representation of the infrastructure as a network of systems that are dynamically interacting. The system response at failure is characterized in terms of two indicators: The buffering capacity to resist an input disturbance up to a certain extent, and the recovery from failure. These measures are given an availability function, to evaluate the probability of system response. The integration of resilience measures into the risk analysis represents a significant innovation in response to the need for a comprehensive modeling framework for the design of critical infrastructures.

First, we perform a top-down analysis through a hierarchical model to identify the elements that at each level have most influence in restoring safety, adopting the criticality importance measure as a quantitative indicator. Then, we evaluate by Monte Carlo simulation the probability that the nuclear power plant enters in an unsafe state and the time needed to recover its safety. The results obtained allow the identification of those elements most critical for the safety and recovery of the nuclear power plant; this is relevant for determining improvements of their structural/functional responses and supporting the decision-making process on safety critical-issues.

The extension includes the evaluation of the effects of uncertain parameters in the model, and the definition of their importance with respect to their influence on the output of the model. Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is selected as the technique because it enables us to 1) consider the simultaneous effects of parameters variations, and 2) to define importance indexes that allow a ranking of the components. GSA requires a large number of evaluations for specific points, identified by an appropriate design of experiment. To avoid the many costly evaluations, a meta-model is built based on polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). A PCE is a multi-dimensional polynomial approximation of the model with coefficients determined by evaluating the model in a reduced set of predetermined points. Importance index values are then derived directly from the PCE. Because, in the problem considered, the model provides the time-dependent behavior of the state probabilities, the importance indexes are also functions of time. An application is presented, related to the cracking process in an Alloy 82/182 dissimilar metal weld in the primary coolant system of a nuclear power plant. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",Degradation | Global sensitivity analysis | Inhomogeneous continuous timeMarkov chain | Multi-state physicsmodel | Parameter uncertainty | Polynomial chaos expansion | State-space enrichment,15,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The perspective is typical for the system of systems analysis of interdependencies in a critical infrastructure (CI), i.e., the smart grid for electricity distribution. We assess how the integration of the two systems copes with requests to increase power generation due to enhanced power consumption at a load bus. We define adequate measures of vulnerability to identify the most limiting communication time delays. We quantify the probability that a reduction in the functionality of the communication system yields a faulty condition in the electric power grid, and find that a factual indicator to quantify the coupling strength between the two networks is the frequency of load-shedding actions due to excessive communication time delay. We evaluate safety margins with respect to communication specifications, i.e., the data rate of the network, to comply with the safety requirements in the electric power grid.

The case in which the information used to feed the model comes from a single expert has been investigated by the authors in a previous work. This paper deals with the different situation in which a number of experts are involved in the elicitation of the uncertain parameters; in particular, each expert provides an interval he/she believes containing the unknown value of the parameter which he/she is knowledgeable about. The different type of available information calls for the development of a different method to represent and propagate the associated uncertainty.

The underlying framework is one of multi-criteria decision-making by an individual consumer who has the goals of increasing the utilization rate of the battery during high electricity demand (so as to decrease the electricity purchase from the external grid) and increasing the utilization rate of the wind turbine for local use (so as to increase the consumer independence from the external grid). Predictions of available wind power feed the reinforcement learning algorithm for selecting the optimal battery scheduling actions. The embedded learning mechanism allows to enhance the consumer knowledge about the optimal actions for battery scheduling under different time-dependent environmental conditions.

In this paper we present an approach for modeling solute diffusive transport in saturated clay minerals at the structure map scale based on an extension of the Kolmogorov-Dmitriev theory of stochastic branching processes. The proposed modeling framework allows a simple description of (i) the dual-porosity behavior typical of some compacted clay structures, where diffusion occurs both in the interlayers and in the pore space between clay particles, and (ii) the chemical interactions between the dissolved ions and the solid matrix surfaces (both at nonequilibrium and equilibrium conditions). Furthermore, the Markovian nature of the modeling approach lends itself to a continuous-time particle-tracking scheme of resolution of the model equations, which, in general, easily allows us to deal with the complex geometrical structures of the porous media. Finally, in order to account for the uncertainty in the geometrical properties of the clay samples within the proposed modeling framework, the structure map is represented as a stochastic network of interconnected, one-dimensional interlayers with different lengths and orientations. The combined methods are demonstrated on a two-dimensional literature case study of diffusion through a compacted clay sample, and the resulting average diffusion coefficients are in general agreement with those obtained by a different simulation-based technique found in the literature.

The proposed approach is verified on a case study predicting the occurrence of railway operation disruptions based on discrete-event data, which is represented by a binary time series. The case study concerns speed restrictions affecting railway operations, caused by failures of tilting systems of railway vehicles. The overall prediction accuracy of the algorithm is 99.93%; the prediction accuracy for occurrence of speed restrictions within the foresight period is 98% (which corresponds to the sensitivity of the algorithm).

This principle aims to reduce over-capacity, over-sized buffers and excessive redundancy. Concurrently, a high level of availability is targeted over the entire production chain. The consequences of unavailability of highly interconnected chemical process plants can be significant because a technical disruption in one plant is able to spread over the entire production network. In chemical process plants not only technical equipment determines the availability, but also storage units, which are able to bridge times of planned or unplanned interruptions of production. To find a balance between the principle of design to capacity and high production availability, the influence of different design parameters, such as capacity of production units, redundancy concept and the size of storage units, have to be evaluated and integrated in the design process. In this article, we present an analytical method for availability evaluation based on extending Semi-Markov processes integrating storage units and multiple production lines. Semi-regenerative states are used to capture the characteristics of storage units, and an approach is proposed in this work to assign distributions for the remaining holding timesin these states.

We examine the uncertainty in the first two (ensemble) moments of the peak concentration, as a consequence of incomplete knowledge of (a) the parameters characterizing the variogram of hydraulic conductivity, (b) the partition coefficient associated with the migrating radionuclide, and (c) dispersivity parameters at the scale of interest.

In this paper, we consider three different cases: (1) a physics-based model of the degradation process is available; (2) a set of degradation observations measured on components similar to the one of interest is available; (3) degradation observations are available only for the component of interest. The objective of the present work is to develop prognostic approaches properly tailored for these three cases and to evaluate them in terms of the assumptions they require, the accuracy of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) predictions they provide and their ability of providing measures of confidence in the predictions. The first case is effectively handled within a particle filtering (PF) scheme, whereas the second and third cases are addressed by bootstrapped ensembles of empirical models. The main methodological contributions of this work are (i) the proposal of a strategy for selecting the prognostic approach which best suits the information setting, even in presence of mixed information sources; (ii) the development of a bootstrap method able to assess the confidence in the RUL prediction in the third case characterized by the unavailability of any degradation observations until failure.

Hence, the reliable and accurate prediction of the scale deposition rate is critical for production availability. In this study, we consider the problem of predicting the scale deposition rate, providing an indication of the associated prediction uncertainty. We tackle the problem using an empirical modeling approach, based on experimental data. Specifically, we implement a multi-objective genetic algorithm (namely, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II)) to train a neural network (NN) (i.e. to find its parameters, that is its weights and biases) to provide the prediction intervals (PIs) of the scale deposition rate. The PIs are optimized both in terms of accuracy (coverage probability) and dimension (width). We perform k-fold cross-validation to guide the choice of the NN structure (i.e. the number of hidden neurons). We use hypervolume indicator metric to evaluate the Pareto fronts in the validation step.

In the gathering facilities and process plant engineering design, the optimization is driven by inputs that are subjected, during the asset life, to changes; this fact, coupled to improvements and modifications in surface facilities, creates the necessity to manage and optimize production scenarios with a more frequent time-frame. Technology improvements have enabled a widespread use of integrated simulation models for a better asset management to be fully combined with measured field data. In this paper we present a dedicated workflow for surface facilities – gathering system and process plant – production enhancement and management coupled with an advanced optimization technique based on a powerful algorithm. The main feature of this algorithm – and consequently of the proposed workflow – is the ability to control many variables simultaneously according to the system constraints even with complex, conflicting and non-direct interconnections between them and the objective to be reached. It has been proven that this algorithm has a robust practice that detects the global optimum of the feasible area avoiding a premature stop in a local optimum region, a situation quite common in highly-constrained and non-linear optimization problems in oil&gas industry. The technical contributions of the work are the abilities to support operations in: definition of field potential, production optimization and de-bottlenecking activities. In the paper a case study that tackles a more complex situation presented in [1], is reported; the proposed workflow’s results are compared with another integrated optimization software available from other software-house, showing an improved ability to detect global optimum combining well management to the plant capabilities.",,21,0,,,,undefined,

Two main approaches for gaining knowledge required for designing and improving critical infrastructures are reliability analysis and vulnerability analysis. The former analyses the ability of the system to perform its intended function; the latter analyses its inability to withstand strains and the effects of the consequent failures. The two approaches have similarities but also some differences with respect to what type of information they generate about the system. In this view, the main purpose of this paper is to discuss and contrast these approaches. To strengthen the discussion and exemplify its findings, a Monte Carlo-based reliability analysis and a vulnerability analysis are considered in their application to a relatively simple, but representative, system the IEEE RTS96 electric power test system. The exemplification reveals that reliability analysis provides a good picture of the system likely behaviour, but fails to capture a large portion of the high consequence scenarios, which are instead captured in the vulnerability analysis. Although these scenarios might be estimated to have small probabilities of occurrence, they should be identified, considered and treated cautiously, as probabilistic analyses should not be the only input to decision-making for the design and protection of critical infrastructures. The general conclusion that can be drawn from the findings of the example is that vulnerability analysis should be used to complement reliability studies, as well as other forms of probabilistic risk analysis. Measures should be sought for reducing both the vulnerability, i.e. improving the system ability to withstand strains and stresses, and the reliability, i.e. improving the likely behaviour. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Critical infrastructures | Power systems | Reliability analysis | Risk management | Vulnerability analysis,160,0,,,MSB,undefined,Myndigheten för Samhällsskydd och Beredskap

The method is to be used for condition monitoring and tracking, and it is based on Gaussian Process (GP) models, which are widely used Bayesian models for nonlinear regression. These models provide great flexibility for regression and the capability of quantifying uncertainty in the form of a posterior predictive distribution. Their main limitation is the difficulty to handle large data sets. For this reason, over the past decade different approximations have been proposed to reduce the computational burden, either global or local. For global approximations of timedependent data, a proper selection of the set of inducing points is crucial for maintaining accuracy and effectiveness, while also reducing the computational costs. In this paper, we propose a strategy to select the inducing points for nonlinear regression of time-dependent data: the algorithm adaptively computes the inducing points as sparse means over moving time-windows. The time windows are selected in order to maximize the similarity between the target variable and the inputs within each window.

Uncertainty in the hourly wind power input is presented as intervals of within-hour variability. A Neural Network (NN) is trained on the interval-valued inputs to provide prediction intervals (PIs) in output. A multi-objective genetic algorithm (namely, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II)) is used to train the NN.

Unreliable service increases operating costs and reduces patronage. In railway systems reliability is significantly influenced by the technical reliability of infrastructure and rolling stock systems. To meet the stringent requirements on reliability and availability, many advanced railway systems and components include monitoring and diagnostic tools. The data generated by these systems can be supplied to data-based methods predicting reliability. Approaches to predict component failures and remaining useful life are usually based on continuously measured diagnostic signal data. The use of event-based diagnostic data is limited. This paper describes our research applying Echo-State Networks (ESN) in combination with Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and fuzzy logic to predict potential railway network disruptions based on discrete-event diagnostic data. The case study focuses on predicting impending failures of a train door system on the level of an individual system potentially causing disruption events of railway operations. The proposed approach achieved an average prediction accuracy of 97 %. The research results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed combination of methods for use in predicting railway operation disruption events. The findings show that the prediction of medium-term class event patterns is especially helpful since railway operators can use this information to take remedial actions to prevent the disruption.

The prediction of the RUL of the a filter is obtained by comparing its degradation trajectory to the reference trajectories and by properly aggregating the RULs of the training trajectories using a weighted sum which takes into account the similarity within test and training trajectories. In order to provide a measure of confidence in the RUL prediction in the form of a prediction interval, we place our work within the framework of belief function theory and we assign to each reference trajectory a belief proportional to its similarity to the test trajectory.

In the first case considered, we have available a stochastic model of the creep growth process and we know the value of the failure threshold, i.e., the maximum creep strain level beyond which the blade cracks. On this basis, a Monte Carlo-based filtering technique, called particle filtering, is set-up to predict the distribution of the system RUL and online-update it when new observations are collected. In the second case considered, the only available information is the sequence of observations of the creep strain of the blade of interest and the value of the failure threshold. On this basis, a data-driven method, based on an ensemble of bootstrap models, has been developed to estimate the turbine blade RUL and the uncertainty of the estimate caused by the uncertainty in the data, the variability of the blades behaviour and the imprecision of the empirical model.

As an important application of time series forecasting, reliability prediction by analyzing the historical time series data of system condition to predict the future system behaviour and/or diagnose the possible system fault, has been solved successfully by SVM with high forecasting accuracy. For this, the critical problem is the selection of SVM parameters. Many methods have been proposed, such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and analytic selection; but there is no generally structured way, yet. In this paper, the capability of SVM to perform function fitting and reliability forecasting based on different methods is investigated by experimenting on both artificial and real-world data. A comparison of the methods is offered on criteria of prediction accuracy and robustness. Finally, an attempt is made to obtain a comparative optimal parameter selection method.

SSA is a relatively new non-parametric data-driven technique developed to model non-linear and/or non-stationary, noisy time series. SSA is able to decompose the original time series into the sum of independent components, which represent the trend, oscillatory behavior (periodic or quasiperiodic components) and noise. One of the main advantages of SSA compared to other non-parametric approaches is that only two parameters are required to model the time series under analysis. An example of application is given, with regards to forecasting the monthly electric load demand in a Venezuelan region served by wind power generators. In this case, careful demand estimation is required since the wind generation output could be highly variable and additional conventional generation or transmission links would be required to satisfy the load demand. A comparison with other classical time-series approaches (like exponential smoothing and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average models) is presented. The results show that SSA is a powerful approach to model time series, capable of identifying sub-time series (trends along with seasonal periodic components).

For accuracy of reliability forecasting, the selection of SVR's parameters is important. The existing research works on SVR's parameters selection divide the example dataset into training and test subsets, and tune the parameters on the training data. However, these fixed parameters can lead to poor prediction capabilities if the data of the test subset differ significantly from those of training. Differently, the novel method proposed in this paper uses particle filtering to estimate the SVR model parameters according to the whole measurement sequence up to the last observation instance. By treating the SVR training model as the observation equation of a particle filter, our method allows updating the SVR model parameters dynamically when a new observation comes. Because of the adaptability of the parameters to dynamic data pattern, the new PF-SVR method has superior prediction performance over that of standard SVR. Four application results show that PF-SVR is more robust than SVR to the decrease of the number of training data and the change of initial SVR parameter values. Also, even if there are trends in the test data different from those in the training data, the method can capture the changes, correct the SVR parameters and obtain good predictions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Particle filter | Reliability prediction | Support vector machines | Time series regression,115,0,,,NSFC,71231001,National Natural Science Foundation of China

We apply an integrated (hybrid) probabilistic-possibilistic computational framework for the joint propagation of the epistemic uncertainty on the values of the (limiting relative frequency) probabilities of the basic events of the fault tree, and we use possibility-probability (probability-possibility) transformations for propagating the epistemic uncertainty within purely probabilistic and possibilistic settings. The results of the different approaches (hybrid, probabilistic, and possibilistic) are compared with respect to the representation of uncertainty about the top event (limiting relative frequency) probability. Both the rationale underpinning the approaches and the computational efforts they require are critically examined. We conclude that the approaches relevant in a given setting depend on the purpose of the risk analysis, and that further research is required to make the possibilistic approaches operational in a risk analysis context. © 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.",Epistemic uncertainty | Fault tree analysis | Possibility-probability (probability-possibility) transformation | Risk analysis,74,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The approach integrates multi-state modeling, which describes the degradation process by transitions among discrete states (e.g. initial, micro-crack, rupture, etc) and physical modeling by (physical) equations that govern the degradation process. In practice, the degradation process is non-Markovian and its transition rates are timedependent and influenced by external factors such as temperature and stress. Under these conditions, it is in general difficult to derive the state probabilities analytically. On the contrary, Petri nets provide a flexible modeling framework for describing degradation processes with arbitrary transition rates. In this paper, we build a Petri net in support of Monte Carlo simulation of the stochastic aging behavior of a nuclear component undergoing stress corrosion cracking.

The parameters (e.g., their mean, variance, ...) of these distributions are usually affected by epistemic (state-of-knowledge) uncertainty, due to limited experience and incomplete knowledge about the phenomena that the distributions represent: the uncertainty framework is then characterized by two hierarchical levels of uncertainty. Probability distributions may be used to characterize also the epistemic uncertainty affecting the parameters of the probability distributions. However, when sufficiently informative data are not available, an alternative and proper way to do this might be by means of possibilistic distributions. In this paper, we use probability distributions to represent aleatory uncertainty and possibility distributions to describe the epistemic uncertainty associated to the poorly known parameters of such probability distributions. A hybrid method is used to hierarchically propagate the two types of uncertainty. The results obtained on a risk model for the design of a flood protection dike are compared with those of a traditional, purely probabilistic, two-dimensional (or double) Monte Carlo approach. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that a hybrid Monte Carlo and possibilistic method is tailored to propagate the uncertainties in a risk model when the uncertainty framework is characterized by two hierarchical levels.

As outcome of the analysis, the probability that the nuclear power plant reaches an unsafe state is computed for different earthquake's epicentre distances and the contribution of the interdependent infrastructures to the safety of such critical plant is highlighted.

This is a critical issue due to the large revenue losses of production reductions and downtimes and to the relevant costs associated to subsea maintenance. An indication of erosion in such valves can be derived from the valve flow coefficient, a parameter related to the effective flow cross-section of the valve and proportional to the choke opening. In practice, for a given opening the deviation of the valve flow coefficient from its nominal value indicates the presence of erosion. To calculate the actual valve flow coefficient a physical model based on process parameters (pressures and mass flow rates) is used; yet, the model has proven incapable of providing reliable values for all process operational conditions. In this paper, we propose a method for calculating the valve flow coefficient based on a hybrid ensemble approach which combines the physical model with an ensemble of kernel regression models.

However, uncertainties are present in the operation and modeling of a T-H passive system and the system may find itself unable to accomplish its function. For the analysis of the system functional failures, a mechanistic code is used and the probability of failure is estimated based on a Monte Carlo (MC) sample of code runs which propagate the uncertainties in the model and numerical values of its parameters/variables. Within this framework, sensitivity analysis aims at determining the contribution of the individual uncertain parameters (i.e., the inputs to the mechanistic code) to (i) the uncertainty in the outputs of the T-H model code and (ii) the probability of functional failure of the passive system. The analysis requires multiple (e.g., many hundreds or thousands) evaluations of the code for different combinations of system inputs: this makes the associated computational effort prohibitive in those practical cases in which the computer code requires several hours to run a single simulation. To tackle the computational issue, in this work the use of the Subset Simulation (SS) and Line Sampling (LS) methods is investigated. The methods are tested on two case studies: the first one is based on the well-known Ishigami function [1]; the second one involves the natural convection cooling in a Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) after a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) [2]. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Functional failure probability | Line Sampling | Nuclear passive system | Reliability sensitivity analysis | Sobol indices | Subset Simulation,59,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The model equations for the expected values of the solute concentration take a form similar to that of classical dual-continua models. On the other hand, the stochastic nature of the modeling approach lends itself to a new particle tracking scheme of resolution, which allows accounting for realistic features of the transport process.

Given the stochastic features of these elements, most modeling approaches rely on Monte Carlo simulation. The computational costs associated to the simulation approach force to treating mostly small-sized systems, i.e. with a limited number of lumped components of a given renewable technology (e.g. wind or solar, etc.) whose behavior is described by a binary state, working or failed. In this paper, we propose an analytical multi-state modeling approach for the reliability assessment of distributed generation (DG). The approach allows looking to a number of diverse energy generation technologies distributed on the system. Multiple states are used to describe the randomness in the generation units, due to the stochastic nature of the generation sources and of the mechanical degradation/failure behavior of the generation systems. The universal generating function (UGF) technique is used for the individual component multi-state modeling. A multiplication-type composition operator is introduced to combine the UGFs for the mechanical degradation and renewable generation source states into the UGF of the renewable generator power output. The overall multi-state DG system UGF is then constructed and classical reliability indices (e.g. loss of load expectation (LOLE), expected energy not supplied (EENS)) are computed from the DG system generation and load UGFs. An application of the model is shown on a DG system adapted from the IEEE 34 nodes distribution test feeder. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Distributed generation | Multi-state modeling | Reliability assessment | Universal generating function,148,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The detection of unseen classes in subsequent data is based on thresholding the normalized weighted average of outputs (NWAO) of the base classifiers in the ensemble.

However, another type of uncertainty (epistemic uncertainty) must be accounted for in the modeling, due to incomplete knowledge of the phenomena and imprecise evaluation of the related characteristic parameters. In circumstances of few informative data, this type of uncertainty calls for alternative methods of representation, propagation, analysis and interpretation. In this study, we make a first attempt to identify, model, and jointly propagate aleatory and epistemic uncertainties in the context of DG systems modeling for adequacy assessment. Probability and possibility distributions are used to model the aleatory and epistemic uncertainties, respectively. Evidence theory is used to incorporate the two uncertainties under a single framework. Based on the plausibility and belief functions of evidence theory, the hybrid propagation approach is introduced. A demonstration is given on a DG system adapted from the IEEE 34 nodes distribution test feeder. Compared to the pure probabilistic approach, it is shown that the hybrid propagation is capable of explicitly expressing the imprecision in the knowledge on the DG parameters into the final adequacy values assessed. It also effectively captures the growth of uncertainties with higher DG penetration levels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Adequacy assessment | Aleatory uncertainty | Distributed generation | Epistemic uncertainty | Evidence theory | Uncertainty propagation,96,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The logic of the protective barriers of the repository is represented by a reliability model. The SS approach is founded on the idea that a small failure probability can be expressed as a product of larger conditional probabilities of some intermediate events; with a proper choice of the conditional events, the conditional probabilities can be sufficiently large to allow accurate estimation with a small number of samples. In the application, the method allows improving the efficiency of the random sampling for estimating the repository containment failure probability. Moreover, the peculiar set-partitioning scheme of the SS method is exploited for performing the analysis of the sensitivity of the failure probability estimate to the uncertain model parameters. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Wear of slurry pump components, caused by abrasive and erosive solid particles, is one of the main causes of reduction in the efficiency and useful life of these pumps. This leads to unscheduled outages that cost companies millions of dollars each year. Traditional maintenance strategies can be applied, but they provide insufficient warning of impending failures. On the other hand, condition monitoring and on-line assessment of the wear status of wetted components in slurry pumps are expected to improve maintenance management and generate significant cost savings for pump operators. In this context, the objective of the present work is to develop and compare two unsupervised clustering ensemble methods, i.e.; fuzzy C-means and hierarchical trees, for the assessment and measurement of the wear status of slurry pumps when available data is extremely limited.

The detection of the system's mode change time represents a particularly challenging task because it requires keeping track of the transitions among the multiple system dynamics corresponding to the different modes of operation and failure. To this purpose, we implement a novel particle filtering method within a log-likelihood ratio approach here, specifically tailored to handle hybrid dynamic systems. The proposed method relies on the generation of multiple particle swarms for each discrete mode, each originating from the nominal particle swarm at different time instants. The hybrid system considered consists of a hold up tank filled with liquid, whose level is autonomously maintained between two thresholds; the system behavior is controlled by discrete mode actuators whose states are estimated by a Monte Carlo-based particle filter on the basis of noise level, and temperature measurements. © 2006 IEEE.",Autonomous transitions | fault detection | hybrid dynamic systems | Monte Carlo estimation | particle filtering,23,0,,,,undefined,

In practice, the involved dependences may burden the modeling of the reliability behavior over time, in which traditional stochastic modeling approaches may likely fail. Empirical prediction methods, such as support vector machines (SVMs), become a valid alternative whenever reliable time series data are available. However, the prediction performance of SVMs depends on the setting of a number of parameters that influence the effectiveness of the training stage during which the SVMs are constructed based on the available data set. The problem of choosing the most suitable values for the SVM parameters can be framed in terms of an optimization problem aimed at minimizing a prediction error. In this work, this problem is solved by particle swarm optimization (PSO), a probabilistic approach based on an analogy with the collective motion of biological organisms. SVM in liaison with PSO is then applied to tackle reliability prediction problems based on time series data of engineered components. Comparisons of the obtained results with those given by other time series techniques indicate that the PSO + SVM model is able to provide reliability predictions with comparable or great accuracy.

Uncertainty importance measures typically reflect to what degree uncertainty about risk and reliability parameters at the component level influences uncertainty about parameters at the system level. The definition of these measures is typically founded on a Bayesian perspective where subjective probabilities are used to express epistemic uncertainty; hence, they do not reflect the effect of imprecision in probability assignments, as captured by alternative uncertainty representation frameworks such as imprecise probability, possibility theory and evidence theory. In the present paper we consider the issue of imprecision in relation to uncertainty importance measures. We define an imprecision importance measure to evaluate the effect of removing imprecision - in the present paper focusing on imprecision removal to the extent that no epistemic uncertainty remains; as further work we suggest to also consider the more general case of imprecision removal to the extent that a probabilistic representation of uncertainty remains.

Under this concept, the objective of degradation modeling becomes the identification of the relations between the environmental and operating conditions of the component and its effective age.

The difference between the theoretical and the actual values of the valve flow coefficient is commonly used during operation as the indicator of the choke erosion. The actual value of the flow coefficient is analytically calculated as a function of measured and allocated parameters. The latter are typically obtained using a physics-based model proved to be inaccurate for some operation conditions. As a consequence, inaccuracies are introduced in the evaluation of the erosion evaluation and this undermines the possibility of using it for prognostic purposes. To overcome this hurdle, a hybrid ensemble of physics-based and Kernel Regression (KR) models is proposed. The method is verified on real measurements.",,4,0,,,,undefined,

This approach integrates multistate modeling, which describes the degradation process through transitions among discrete states (e.g., initial, microcrack, rupture, etc.), and physics modeling by (physics) equations that describe the degradation process within the states. In reality, the degradation process is non-Markovian, its transition rates are time-dependent, and the degradation is possibly influenced by uncertain external factors such as temperature and stress. Under these conditions, it is in general difficult to derive the state probabilities analytically. In this paper, we overcome this difficulty by building a simulation model supported by a stochastic Petri net representing the multistate degradation process. The proposed modeling approach is applied to the problem of a nuclear component undergoing stress corrosion cracking. The results are compared with those derived from the state-space enrichment Markov chain approximation method applied in a previous work of literature. © 2012 IEEE.",Component degradation | Monte Carlo simulation | multistate physics model | nonhomogeneous Markov process | stochastic Petri net,50,0,,,,undefined,

Whereas aleatory uncertainty is always described by probability distributions, epistemic uncertainty may be represented in different ways (e.g., probabilistic or possibilistic), depending on the information and data available. The work presented in this paper addresses the issue of accounting for (in)dependence relationships between epistemically-uncertain parameters. When a probabilistic representation of epistemic uncertainty is considered, uncertainty propagation is carried out by a two-dimensional (or double) Monte Carlo (MC) simulation approach; instead, when possibility distributions are used, two approaches are undertaken: the hybrid MC and Fuzzy Interval Analysis (FIA) method and the MC-based Dempster-Shafer (DS) approach employing Independent Random Sets (IRSs). The objectives are: i) studying the effects of (in)dependence between the epistemically-uncertain parameters of the aleatory probability distributions (when a probabilistic/possibilistic representation of epistemic uncertainty is adopted) and ii) studying the effect of the probabilistic/possibilistic representation of epistemic uncertainty (when the state of dependence between the epistemic parameters is defined). The Dependency Bound Convolution (DBC) approach is then undertaken within a hierarchical setting of hybrid (probabilistic and possibilistic) uncertainty propagation, in order to account for all kinds of (possibly unknown) dependences between the random variables. The analyses are carried out with reference to two toy examples, built in such a way to allow performing a fair quantitative comparison between the methods, and evaluating their rationale and appropriateness in relation to risk analysis. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Aleatory and epistemic uncertainties | dependences | dependency bound convolution | fuzzy interval analysis | possibility distributions | two-dimensional Monte Carlo method,12,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Unscheduled shutdowns with interruption of production can result from the deposition of lime scale, which can block valves, tubing and flowlines of the oil wells plants. Thus, the prediction of lime scale is fundamental in order to control the performance of valves and actuators, which are expected to operate for a certain period of time under required operating conditions. To this purpose, laboratory tests have been conducted on different materials (25-Cr, 13-Cr, In718, WC) used in off-shore drilling in order to study lime scale deposition under controlled environmental and working conditions (Moura et al., 2011). The data collected in these tests are analysed in this work, to study the influence of the experiment inputs (e.g., material, roughness, sample initial weight, test temperature, etc.) on the outputs (i.e, rate of scale deposition and lime scale final weight and thickness). The idea is to identify the inputs which have the greatest influence on lime scale thickness variations to eventually use them to build an empirical model of the degradation of the oil wells valves and actuators. A sensitivity analysis is performed by resorting to a classification tree, a tree-like graph in which each laboratory test occupies one of the leaves of the tree. The key point of the method is the choice of the selection rules to classify the data. The input variances in the subclasses which are generated at every branching step provide useful information about the most significant inputs. Results are confirmed by different correlation coefficients (Linear, Spearman Rank Order and Kendall's Tau). Copyright © 2012, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,11,0,,,,undefined,

In this paper we propose an approach to optimally group the signals. We use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for the optimization of the groups; the decision variables of the optimization problem relate to the composition of the groups (i.e., which signals they contain) and the objective function (fitness) driving the search for the optimal grouping is constructed in terms of quantitative indicators of the performances of the condition monitoring models themselves: in this sense, the GA search engine is a wrapper around the condition monitoring models. A real case study is considered, concerning the condition monitoring of the Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) of a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). The optimization results are evaluated with respect to the accuracy and robustness of the monitored signals estimates. The condition monitoring models built on the groups found by the proposed approach outperform the model which uses all available signals, whereas they perform similarly to the models built on groups based on signal correlation. However, these latter do not guarantee the robustness of the reconstruction in case of abnormal conditions and require to a priori fix characteristics of the groups, such as the desired minimum correlation value in a group. © 2011 - IOS Press and the author(s).

However, uncertainties in the signal measurements and incompleteness in the representativeness of the measured data can overshadow the conclusions drawn from condition monitoring, and possibly lead the decision-maker to take wrong actions. In order to reduce the risk of wrong actions, confidence measures on the condition monitoring indications of the state of a component must be provided, so that the decision-maker can know to what degree he or she should trust such indications. As condition monitoring is usually structured in two modules performed in succession, one of reconstruction of the signal values in normal operating conditions and a following one of equipment health state diagnosis, it is reasonable to define confidence measures for the two processes individually, and then integrate the two into a single criterion for the whole condition monitoring. The research presented in this paper focuses on the definition of confidence measures for the signal reconstruction part of condition monitoring. The Evolving Clustering Method (ECM) is adopted to build the empirical model of signal reconstruction. Requirements for the reconstruction confidence are originally defined, and a single confidence measure is proposed to meet all the requirements identified. The confidence measure is analyzed with respect to two-dimensional artificial datasets and a real dataset concerning the Reactor Coolant Pump of a French Pressurized Water Reactor. The results obtained show that the proposed confidence measure meets all requirements and is more informative than the reconstruction error. © 2011 IEEE.",condition monitoring | confidence measure | evolving clustering method | signal reconstruction,5,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Efficient visualization techniques for Pareto Front and Set analyses are needed for helping decision makers in the selection task. In this paper, we consider the multiobjective optimization of system redundancy allocation and use the recently introduced Level Diagrams technique for graphically representing the resulting Pareto Front and Set. Each objective and decision variable is represented on separate diagrams where the points of the Pareto Front and Set are positioned according to their proximity to ideally optimal points, as measured by a metric of normalized objective values.

In this work, the modeling of interdependencies among network systems and of their effects on failure propagation is carried out within the simulation framework of a failure cascade process.

The original fuzzy logic-based modelling framework includes maintenance as an IF; this requires one to jointly model its effects on the component degradation together with those of the other influencing factors. This may not come natural to the experts who are requested to provide the if-then linguistic rules at the basis of the fuzzy model linking the IFs with the component degradation state. An alternative modelling approach is proposed in this work, which does not consider maintenance as an IF that directly impacts on the degradation but as an external action that affects the state of the other IFs.

To overcome this, partial discharge (PD) measurements have been proposed as a relatively economic and simple-to-apply experimental technique for retrieving information on the state of health of an electrical cable. The retrieval is based on a relationship between PD measurements and the health of the cable. Given the difficulties in capturing such relationship by analytical models, empirical modeling techniques based on experimental data have been propounded. In this view, a set of PD measurements have been collected by Enea Ricerca sul Sistema Elettrico-ERSE during past campaigns, for building a diagnostic system of electrical cable health state. These experimental data may contain contradictory information which remarkably reduces the performance of the state classifier, if not a priori identified and possibly corrected. In the present paper, a novel technique based on the Adaboost algorithm is proposed for identifying contradictory PD patterns within an a priori analysis aimed at improving the diagnostic performance.

The computational effort involved can be prohibitive because of the large number of (typically long) T-H code simulations that must be performed (one for each sample) for the statistical estimation of the probability of success or failure. The objective of this work is to provide operative guidelines to effectively handle the computation of the reliability of a nuclear passive system. Two directions of computation efficiency are considered: from one side, efficient Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) techniques are indicated as a means to performing robust estimations with a limited number of samples: in particular, the Subset Simulation (SS) and Line Sampling (LS) methods are identified as most valuable; from the other side, fast-running, surrogate regression models (also called response surfaces or meta-models) are indicated as a valid replacement of the long-running T-H model codes: in particular, the use of bootstrapped Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is shown to have interesting potentials, including for uncertainty propagation.

A library of reference multidimensional trajectory patterns from failure scenarios is created. When a new failure scenario develops, its evolution pattern is compared by fuzzy similarity analysis to the reference multidimensional trajectory patterns. The time remaining before the developing trajectory pattern hits a failure threshold is predicted by combining the times of failure of the reference patterns, weighed by their similarity to the developing pattern. For illustration purposes, a case study of literature is considered regarding the estimation of the available RT in failure scenarios of the Lead Bismuth Eutectic eXperimental Accelerator Driven System (LBE-XADS).

Generally, system reliability depends on a number of factors, e.g. aging, operational and maintenance conditions.

In these cases, empirical modeling may be an effective way for reliability prediction. In this paper, the powerful empirical modeling paradigm of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is investigated, with respect to the dependence of their performance depends on a set of real-valued parameters that govern the learning phase.

In practice, experts might be reluctant to characterise their knowledge using precise probabilities. The theory of possibility allows for imprecision in probability assignments to be accounted for, and the possibilistic representation of epistemic uncertainty can be both combined with and transformed into a probabilistic representation. In the present paper we combine probability and possibility to represent epistemic uncertainty in a simple fault tree analysis. We apply an integrated (hybrid) probabilistic-possibilistic computational framework for the joint propagation of the epistemic uncertainty. Then we use a possibility-probability transformation and propagate the epistemic uncertainty within a purely probabilistic setting. The results of the two different approaches (hybrid and probabilistic) are compared with respect to the representation of uncertainty about the top event (limiting relative frequency) probability. Both the rationale underpinning the approaches and the computational efforts they require are examined.

Pareto Front solutions are identified by a genetic algorithm and then clustered by subtractive clustering into ""families"". On the basis of the decision maker's preferences, each family is then synthetically represented by a ""head of the family"" solution. This is done by introducing a scoring system that ranks the solutions with respect to the different objectives: a fuzzy preference assignment is employed to this purpose. Level Diagrams are then used to represent, analyze and interpret the Pareto Fronts reduced to the head-of-the-family solutions.",Fuzzy preference assignment | Fuzzy preference scoring | Genetic algorithms | Level Diagrams | Multiobjective optimization | Nuclear power plant | Pareto Front | Pareto set | Safety system | Subtractive clustering | Test intervals optimization,7,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,
