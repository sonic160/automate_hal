A literature search is conducted systematically based on pre-defined protocols. The resulting papers are first analyzed through a meta-data and bibliometric analysis, in which the trend of publication growth, important publication sources and authors, collaboration among the authors are identified. The evolution of research topics in three time periods (prior to mid-1990s, mid-1990s - 2010 and 2010 - present) is also discussed through a semantic clustering. Then, the most important papers from the literature search are chosen for a content analysis and critical review. The main results of the critical literature review include: First, we summarize the dependent failure behavior in different system hierarchies, i.e., failure mechanism level, component level, system level and systems-of-systems level. In each level, the main dependent failure behavior from literature is discussed with examples. Second, we develop a classification framework for the dependent failure behavior models. The most frequently-used models in each category are critically reviewed, based on which we identify five challenging problems the current dependency models face, give our perspectives on their possible solutions, and discuss future research opportunities.",Dependent failure behavior | Reliability | Risk,2,0,,,EDF,undefined,Orange

These novel applications, on the other hand, bring new challenges to network resilience. Among them, traffic variation is one of the most vital threats to the 5G network. With tens of thousands of devices connected to the network, network service resilience is threatened by the heavy traffic change induced by the end users or malicious attacks. While long timescale traffic variation can be easily predicted based on historical data, short timescale abnormal traffic is hard to forecast yet can significantly violate the service requirements. The impact of short timescale traffic variation can be mitigated by 5G management and control systems. However, the complexity and dynamics of the virtualized 5G system make it hard to estimate its resilience. This paper provides a 5G network model that captures the data traffic changes and network dynamic management mechanism. The model is able to evaluate the performance of different network services with different requirements under traffic variation events. We analyze the effectiveness of auto-scaling and compare different isolation strategies for traffic congestion.

In case of failures due to natural events, random disturbances, or deliberate attacks, the design of the coupling interface is a key factor for maintaining high performance within the interdependent CIs. However, in the existing literature, the issue of the coupling interface design is often addressed through heuristics. In this work, we propose an optimization-based mathematical approach for designing coupling interfaces between interdependent critical infrastructures under random failures.

In this paper, we therefore develop probabilistic RUL prognostics using Convolutional Neural Networks. These prognostics are further integrated into maintenance planning, both for single and multiple components. We illustrate our approach for aircraft turbofan engines. The results show that the optimal replacement time for the engines is close to the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval of the RUL estimates. We also show that our proposed maintenance approach leads to a cost reduction of 53% compared to a traditional Time-based maintenance strategy. Moreover, compared with the ideal case when the true RUL is known in advance (perfect RUL prognostics), our approach leads to a limited number of failures.

Reinforcement learning provides a promising perspective to overcome the issue. In this paper, we studied CBM optimization for a multi-component system in which the components degrade subject to the gamma process independently. We considered multiple maintenance choices for individual components, leading to a large combinatorial action space. In this case, traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms like DQN may struggle to face the inefficiency of exploration. Instead, we propose exploiting Branching Dueling Q-network (BDQ), which incorporates the action branching architecture into DQN to drastically decrease the number of estimated actions. We trained a learning agent to minimize the expected cost for a long time horizon by taking maintenance actions according to the observed exact degrading signal for each component. We compared the policy learned by the agent with some other pre-defined static policies.

The proposed model is a novel epidemiological compartmental model formulated as a non-linear programming model that is suitable to address the inherent non-linearity of an infectious disease progression within the population. A number of novel features are implemented in the model to take into account important disease characteristics, such as asymptomatic infection and the distinct risk levels of infection within different segments of the population. Moreover, a method is proposed to estimate the vulnerability level of the different communities impacted by the pandemic and to explicitly consider equity in the resource allocation problem. The model is validated against real data for a case study of COVID-19 outbreak in France and our results provide various insights on the optimal testing intervention time and level, and the impact of the optimal allocation of testing resources on the spread of the disease among regions.

In fact, DRO allows protecting the decision-maker from the ambiguity arising from the imprecisely identified probability distributions of the failure scenarios. In this framework, the probability distribution of the failure scenarios is assumed to be known ambiguously, and contained in an ambiguity set defined by moment-based conditions. In practice, some decisions taken in the protection plan affect the conditions of the ambiguity set. We refer to this situation as DRO with endogenous uncertainty.

We consider a single-unit system, subjected to random degradation and failures, and for which the current degradation state can be partially observed via an imperfect monitoring system. The system state space is finite, and we model the following maintenance operations: i) perfect inspection, ii) preventive maintenance and iii) corrective maintenance. The goal is to optimize the maintenance policy by taking into account the imperfect monitoring data in order to minimize the expected discounted maintenance cost over an infinite time horizon. We formulate the problem as a POMDP where, at each time step, it should be decided whether or not to conduct a maintenance operation, and if so, which one. To keep the model general and flexible, we suppose that monitoring data are collected every K time steps (i.e. one observation epoch). The model is completed by a constraint imposing that only one maintenance operation can be conducted per observation epoch. Eventually, we solve it using a PBVI algorithm. The value function is approximated by interpolation of grid data points, and new relevant points are dynamically added into the grid where they most improve the value function. This approach is compared to a POMDP modeling based on approximate sample paths (ASP); when evaluated in different cost scenarios, the proposed approach systematically finds better maintenance policies for a comparable computation time.

In this article, we propose an improved deep learning-based fault diagnosis framework for EMAs based on triplet network with coupled cluster losses. Unlike the traditional approaches, the proposed framework learns to predict similarity between samples, rather than the fault labels directly. The trained model is used to calculate the distance between testing samples and a set of benchmark samples with known labels. Fault diagnosis is, then, conducted based on the $K$-nearest neighbor algorithm.

The safety function of a PSV is to open and relieve the pressure when the equipment pressure exceeds the predefined set point. To achieve the desired availability of the PSV function, periodic function testing is regularly performed to confirm the correct functioning of a PSV. If a fault of the PSV function is detected by a function test, the PSV is repaired to a functioning state. For this reason, the interval between function tests has a direct influence on the probability of failure on demand (PFD) of the PSV function. On the other hand, unwanted leakage can occur due to human errors made during the preparation prior to a test and the reinstatement after the test. Such leakage is not desired due to the potential for being ignited and causing a major accident, but this aspect is often not considered in the availability assessment of PSVs. Therefore, this paper suggests a multi-phase Markov approach that can estimate the PFD of a PSV as well as the frequency of the leaks induced by the periodic tests. The suggested approach may be suitable for supporting the decision about the test interval for a PSV, considering both reliability and risk effect of extending the function test interval.",,1,0,,,,undefined,

They promised more reliable equipment and a safer environment. An all-electric production system performs several functions related to hydrocarbon production control. It also performs safety functions by isolating the reservoir from the environment. Safety functions are performed by activation of safety valves. These safety valves include electric springs in their design instead of mechanical springs. Failure modes and effects analysis of these valves show that interruptions in the power supply appear as random demands to the safety valves, and experiencing such demands may deteriorate their performance. However, the current reliability assessment of safety valves does not consider any degradation phenomena. This paper's main objective is to investigate the degradation modes caused by demands and their influence on the all-electric actuation system's performance under different maintenance strategies. A degradation modeling framework based on the multiphase Markov process is proposed. The impact of demand is modeled by changing the initial condition or by increasing the transition rates between two degraded states. The amplitude of the increment depends on the condition at the time of the demand.

Accordingly, mathematical modelling and optimization of CBM has become of interest for industry managers and researchers. This work explores on the application of a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) to encompass different modelling assumptions as non-negligible maintenance delays and inspection-based condition monitoring. These assumptions are relevant for many critical infrastructures in civil engineering or in oil & gas industry whose deterioration states are classified at a very high level of abstraction among a finite and small set of possible states. A formalism to model this type of problems is proposed in which the deterministic motion of the PDMP is reduced to a trivial differential equation to track the time elapsed between events. A numerical scheme for quantification, as an approximation of the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation, is presented. Later, an illustration case dealing with CBM of road bridges by the NPRA (Norwegian Public Roads Administration) is presented, guiding through the modelling and quantification approach.",Condition-based maintenance | Monte Carlo simulation | Numerical analysis | Piecewise deterministic Markov process | Road bridges maintenance | Stochastic modelling,17,0,,,NTNU,undefined,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet

The degradation is generally described by a monotone Stochastic process. Upon periodical inspection, the system is preventively replaced whenever its degradation level exceeds a pre-determined threshold or failure occurs.

The majority of European railway networks are electrified, and power transmission networks represent usually the main power supplier. Railway and power networks share thus a unidirectional interdependency, as the railway network functionality depends on the power network. Due to this interdependency, failures in power networks have the potential of causing vast disruption in the dependent railway networks. Despite this, the issue of modeling interdependent railway and power networks has not been addressed sufficiently carefully in the existing literature. Furthermore, the treatment of cascading failures in power networks and their consequences in railway networks is limited and approximative. In this work, we propose a modeling framework which accounts for more realistic assumptions on the interconnections topology and the cascading failures dynamics. Firstly, we model the interconnections between the railway and external power network by introducing the traction power network, which acts as a bridge between the external power grid and the railway network. Secondly, we model cascading failures in the external and traction power networks with an approach based on the DC power flow model. Thirdly, we suggest a simple approach to estimate the negative consequences on the railway network due to load shedding in the traction power network. Vulnerability analysis is performed to estimate the negative consequences in the railway network due to different failure scenarios in the external power network.

These models will shift the CI interdependencies towards a new dynamic paradigm where communication resources are deployed within the CIs operational scheme to reach performance and quality of service (QoS) objectives. Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Network Slicing (NS) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) are examples of 5G-enabling technologies used to reach the aforementioned objectives.

The intrinsic degradation of each component is modelled with a pure jump Lévy process. The idea of the failure dependence is motivated by complex engineering systems where the failure of one component may cause a momentary, transient shock to the system. The effect of the shock is modelled by a random magnitude of increment in the degradation level of each surviving component. Perfect periodic inspections are carried out on the system. Upon inspection, highly deteriorated or failed components are perfectly replaced and hence are restored to an as-good-as-new state. Nothing is done to the rest of the components. For such a system, the evaluation of the reliability and the assessment of the maintenance planning are quite complex due to the failure dependence as well as the imperfect maintenance at the system level. In this study, we address these problems by the implementation of Markov renewal theory.

When the reasonable initiation situation of a PM and the optimal maintenance degree are identified, lifetime cost of the final element can be minimized while keeping satisfying the integrity level requirement for the SIS. A numerical example is introduced to illustrate how the presenting methods are used to examine the effects of maintenance strategies on cost and the average probability of failure on demands (PFDavg) of a SIS. Intervals of the upcoming tests thus can be updated to provide maintenance crews with more clues on cost-effective tests without weakening safety.",Degradation | Final element | Maintenance strategy | PFD avg | Preventive maintenance | Safety-instrumented system,18,1,repositoryvor,Green,CSC,201706440015,Marie Curie

In low-demand mode of operation, final elements of SIS mostly remain idle and safety performance is measured by probability of failure on demand on average (PFDavg). In this mode, SIS are not continuously monitored but subjected to periodic tests (namely proof tests) to ascertain availability for demand situations. Sometimes, proof tests don't reveal all undetected dangerous failures and may even deteriorate mechanical components by introducing additional stress. To model such degradation phenomena, we propose a framework (based on multiphase Markov process) by adding discrete degraded states between the working and the failed states. The impact of tests is modelled by increasing the transition rates between degraded states. The amplitude increase depends on the current system state at testing time. Then, analytical formulas are developed for the evaluation of the time-dependent PFD under various maintenance policies. Later, a case study on Down hole safety valves (DHSV) is presented to find an optimum test frequency. The optimization problem arises due to the following trade-off: high frequency testing will ensure high availability of DHSV for demand situation, but the stress generated will accelerate degradation to resultant failure.",Harm full tests | Hidden degradation | Imperfect testing | Multi-phase Markov process | Performance analysis | SIS Under degradation,16,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

The main objective of this work is to investigate the health-aware control of a subsea CO2 separation system. Previously identified linear models were used in a predictive controller with Kalman filter-based state estimation and online model update, and simulations were performed to evaluate the controller tuning. Regarding prognostics, a stochastic model of pump degradation, sensitive to its operating conditions, was proposed, and a particle filter was implemented to perform online degradation state estimation and remaining useful lifetime prediction. Finally, a health-aware controller was designed, which could extend the life of the process by four months when compared to operation with a conventional model predictive controller. Some difficulties in combining reference tracking and lifetime extension objectives were also investigated.

In Norway, bridges are a vital part of the transportation infrastructure. With more than 18,000 road bridges across the country, an efficient bridge management system is of critical importance to avoid high costs from over expending, to ensure safety of the public and availability of the transportation system. In the bridge management system applied by NPRA, the inspections are mainly carried out periodically based on pre-defined rules and the decision about when to perform the maintenance is based on the findings of these inspections. The objective of this paper is to propose a modelling framework that makes it possible to challenge these pre-defined rules by doing degradation prognostic and maintenance optimization. We propose to use a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process to encompass different modelling assumptions as non-negligible maintenance delays and time dependent inspections. State probabilities and performance indicators are assessed through Monte Carlo simulations and a numerical scheme.

Simplest structure of a SIS consists of a sensor to detect anomaly of a given process parameter, a logic solver to decide appropriate actions given the nature of detected anomaly and a final element to execute necessary actions to prevent an imminent failure. As a critical safety barrier, unavailability assessment of SIS receives a great deal of attention and its safety requirement is regulated mainly by IEC 61508 standard. It demands a systematic and quantitative evaluations of SIS unavailability by some suggested methods such as Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD), Markov Chains, Petri Nets, etc. which must then be compliant with the SIL (Safety Integrity Level) required for that particular application. In general, quantification of SIS unavailability adopts a convenient assumption that failure rates of the SIS elements are constant over the operational lifetime. Although such an assumption is usually justified for sensor and logic solver subsystems of a SIS, it may not be equally valid for final elements. These final elements are often located and operated in harsh environment-making them subject to degradation. Furthermore partial tests and proof tests for maintenance purpose are believed to have some negative impact on the condition of the final element. Several challenges exist when considering time-dependent failure in unavailability quantification, for instance, difficulties in detecting failures due to passive nature of low demand SISs, lack of relevant data for parameter estimation when modeling with stochastic processes, imperfectness of tests, non-periodicity in testing practice, etc. In this paper, a multiphase Markov model is proposed to model a SIS final element subject to both partial and full proof test by considering the negative impact due to tests, non-detection and non-negligible repair time. The analytical model is validated by Monte Carlo simulation and the impact of negative tests and non-detection is discussed in the light of sensitivity analysis. Finally, number of partial tests over a given mission time is optimized to show the trade off between PFDavg and number of tests.",Low demand mode | Multiphase Markov | Negative test impact | PFD | Safety Instrumented System,0,0,,,,undefined,

Periodic tests with the interval τ are executed to check the subsystem state.

The first objective of this paper is to develop a dynamic grouping model in the presence of both corrective and preventive maintenance duration for complex structure systems. A new practical maintenance cost model is proposed allowing to take into consideration of maintenance duration and system structure as well as economic dependence between components. Taking into maintenance duration and system structure leads, however, to a complex grouping model, which is efficiently solved by the proposed analytical methods. The second objective is to investigate the impacts of maintenance duration on grouping modeling and grouping optimization. Both theoretical and experimental studies give a complete vision about maintenance duration impacts and some recommendations in real applications.

Component 2 fails when its total accumulative damage exceeds a pre-determined level L. By considering the consumer's behavior and the product service time, the warranty costs allocations between the manufacturer and the consumer are presented.

These systems are generally passive and are activated only on demand. Testing is then required to diagnose their current state and to take the corresponding maintenance action. However, the testing procedure can provoke damage on some units of the SIS (especially the mechanical parts) and the system as a whole becomes more prone to failures. This situation is currently not well covered by standards under the so-called umbrella of imperfect testing. The decision maker must in practice come across to an optimization problem where the objective is to determine the optimal compromise between an accurate diagnostic of the current system state (high tests frequency) and the possible failures or degradation provoked by the testing procedure itself. The commonly used criteria to assess the performance of SIS are all related to the mean downtime of the SIS between two tests. The IEC 61508 provides subsequent analysis for multi-unit SIS when all the units are supposed to follow exponential lifetime distributions. It cannot be applied in this case as some parts of the system have a time varying failure rate which can increase after every test. We propose the use a of Markov process to model the degradation of the mechanical parts upon test and possible preventive maintenance after testing. Since the degradation due to tests is experienced at deterministic dates, we use the modelling framework of multiphase Markov processes to calculate the mean downtime.

To lower the price of energy, the authors want to improve the modeling of offshore wind farms in order to help improving the applied maintenance strategies. In this paper, we investigate the repair of wind turbine components as an alternating renewal process. The time it takes to repair (renew) a component in a turbine, directly influences the downtime of this turbine, or even larger parts of the wind farm. This downtime leads to production losses, which in turn raise the cost of energy. Previous investigations by two of the present authors showed that a variation in repair times has a significant influence of the production losses. In this paper, an alternate renewal process is investigated as tool to calculate the influence of the repair time duration on the production losses. We show that if we assume an exponential distribution of repair times, the distribution of the downtimes can be calculated analytically. The results are demonstrated with a case study, based on available failure rates and repair times. For other distributions, the calculation has to be done numerically, after fitting the parameters of the distribution to the available data.

The effects of testing errors and postponed repairs on the tendency of unavailability in partial testing phases are checked in the proposed models.

One important objective is to be able to anticipate future maintenance actions required to optimize the logistic and future investments. That is why, over the past few years, the predictive maintenance approaches have been an expanding area of research. They rely on the concept of prognosis. Many papers have shown how dynamic Bayesian networks can be relevant to represent multicomponent complex systems and carry out reliability studies. The diagnosis and maintenance group from French institute of science and technology for transport, development and networks (IFSTTAR) developed a model (VirMaLab: Virtual Maintenance Laboratory) based on dynamic Bayesian networks in order to model a multicomponent system with its degradation dynamic and its diagnosis and maintenance processes. Its main purpose is to model a maintenance policy to be able to optimize the maintenance parameters due to the use of dynamic Bayesian networks. A discrete state-space system is considered, periodically observable through a diagnosis process. Such systems are common in railway or road infrastructure fields. This article presents a prognosis algorithm whose purpose is to compute the remaining useful life of the system and update this estimation each time a new diagnosis is available. Then, a representation of this algorithm is given as a dynamic Bayesian network in order to be next integrated into the Virtual Maintenance Laboratory model to include the set of predictive maintenance policies.

The main feature of these systems is their ability within a closed-loop to drive actuators in order to set the controlled process in a given state. Usually, the existing literature deals with the diagnosis of faults of a control system and the means to recover system performances after their appearance. The controller reconfiguration is one of these means. The root cause of a fault is rarely argued nor its occurrence time. Before designing maintenance policies, this paper proposes a stochastic modeling framework of a degrading control system focusing on the actuator deterioration. It is based on the assumption of a close relationship between the controller setting, the actuator deterioration and finally its faulty situations. These latter are related to given degradation thresholds. Due to the stochastic nature of the deterioration, the thresholds hitting times are random. The obtained model allows the conditional reliability of the actuator to be assessed and then the prognosis of its residual useful life (RUL). This RUL is finally used to achieve two maintenance policies based upon the reconfiguration of the controller which is therefore considered as a new maintenance action.",Actuator | condition-based maintenance | control system | degradation | loss of effectiveness | prognosis | stochastic process,11,0,,,,undefined,

On the other hand, it is important to provide calculation and optimization tools in order find an optimal grouped maintenance planning and to update a it in presence of a ""dynamic context"" which may randomly occur on-line. The modeling framework that is chosen is mainly based on reliability theory and stochastic modeling. In that way, the chapter presents firstly several models for maintenance grouping based on the rolling horizon. These models are then developed taking in consideration of maintenance constraints such as limited maintenance teams and/or restricted maintenance duration which may significantly impact the maintenance planning. The proposed models can help not only to establish an optimal grouped maintenance planning but also to efficiently update it in dynamic context (occurrence of maintenance opportunities, changes of repairmen, availability level, etc.). To reduce the computing time, optimal algorithms such as MULTIFIT, generic algorithms are implemented.

It is used to determine the quality of the computed reliability indicators and prognostic estimates.

Many studies have shown how Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) can be relevant in representing complex multicomponent systems and in performing reliability studies. In a previous paper [10], Donat et al. introduced a type of degradation model based on DBNs called a graphical duration model (GDM) for discrete-state systems to represent a wide range of duration models. This paper introduces a new type of degradation model based on the GDM approach that integrates the concept of conditional sojourn time distributions (CSTDs) to improve the degradation modelling. It introduces the possibility of considering many degradation dynamics simultaneously. It allows the degradation modelling to be adapted based on newly available observations of a system to account for changes in dynamics over time.

The failure dependence of two-component systems was proposed by Murthy & Nguyen (1985) in which they introduced three types of failure interaction. Type I failure interaction supposes that a failed component can induce the simultaneous failure of the remaining (Scarf & Deara 1998, Scarf & Deara 2003, Jhang & Sheu 2000, Liu, Wu, & Xie 2015). Instead of inducing simultaneous failure, Type II failure interaction assumes that whenever a component fails, it causes an increase of the survival component’s failure rate because of extra shocks, stress or loads and so forth (Zequeira & Bérenguer 2005).

In fact, based on the degradation and failure model of the considered k-out-of-n:F system, two new opportunistic predictive maintenance strategies with different types of maintenance decision-making are proposed.

Positive dependencies are commonly due to setup cost whereas negative dependencies are related to shutdown cost. Actually, grouping maintenance activities can save part of the setup cost, but can also in the same time increase the shutdown cost. Until now, both types of dependencies have been jointly taken into account only for simple system structures as pure series. The first aim of this paper is to investigate the case of systems with any combination of basic structures (series, parallel or k-out-of n structures). A cost model and a heuristic optimization scheme are proposed since the optimization of maintenance grouping strategy for such multi-component systems leads to a NP-complete problem. Then the second objective is to propose a finite horizon (dynamic) model in order to optimize online the maintenance strategy in the presence of dynamic contexts (change of the environment, the working condition, the production process, etc). A numerical example of a 16-component system is finally introduced to illustrate the use and the advantages of the proposed approach in the maintenance optimization framework. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Complex systems | Dynamic grouping | Economic dependence | Genetic algorithm | Maintenance optimization | Multi-component systems,115,0,,,,undefined,

Previous research treated such initial uncertainties more as unwanted noises, and concentrated on how to control their influence on later prediction. However in this paper, we saw the initial uncertainties as a part of the stochastic degradation model. Supposing that the degradation process is a time-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, we considered different hypotheses for initial uncertainties from a data-analysis and engineering view respectively, which were treated totally as 2 different models: one is with initial uncertainties and the other is with a constant start 0. The explanation in real applications for these 2 choices are clear. As the equipment's degradation is recorded when it is ""new"", so engineers think there should not be any degradation at all which appear in data as 0. However in real degradation data, we found that those ""new"" equipments may probably have initial degradations which appear as initial uncertainties subject to the measurement errors, imperfect production procedures etc. So we did some simulation tests to judge which hypothesis is better for the given degradation data and models' performance on parameter estimation, evaluation results and prediction ability is compared when a real degradation data set is compared. It is concluded from the simulation results that the model considering initial degradation predicts first passage failure more conservatively than the one ignoring initial degradation based on the given degradation data. Also under Akaike information criterion and other criterions, the model considering initial degradation's influence is better the one ignoring considering initial degradation. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London..",,2,0,,,,undefined,

To address this problem, predictive maintenance seems to be one of the most effective known approaches. It consists of driving the maintenance process anticipating the evolution of the system state. A prediction process, called ""prognostic"" could also be introduced and it lays on the online estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) have been proved as relevant to perform reliability analysis as they can easily represent complex systems behaviors. Based on this formalism, Graphical Duration Models (GDM) were developed by R. Donat (2009) to set all kind of sojourn time distributions for each state of the system. Unlike to some Markovian modelling that imposes exponential behavior, this approach could better model the exact degradation dynamic of real industrial systems (F.V. Jensen 2007) (J. Pearl 1985). In our study, where time and states spaces are discretized, a single component degradation whom process is assumed to be monotone increasing, is considered. The real state of the system is unknown but periodically observed by monitoring devices, characterized by their good detections rates, false alarms rates and non detection rates (summarized in a confusion matrix as a conditional probability table of the considered DBN). This paper introduces an online RUL estimation algorithm based on the use of graphical duration models. The objective is both to evaluate the RUL and to adjust it, in real time, when a new observation is available. Then, the algorithm is applied to a testcase to evaluate the quality of the RUL estimations. This paper will also provide comparative results in respect of the considered degradation model ( Markovian approach vs GDM). Finally, these RUL computations, and the associated estimations of the future system behavior, might be subsequently used to optimize the maintenance strategy and the diagnosis schedule. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London..",,0,0,,,,undefined,

The systems usually ask for a high investment cost (expensive components) and many preparation tasks for maintenance. With these system, a maintenance policy should take into account the complexity of system structures and give priority to saving the setup costs. Therefore, an intelligent grouping maintenance strategy for complex structure systems is developed in this paper. Under this strategy, a group of components is decided to Preventively Maintained (PM) at each τ (basic time interval) due to component Mean Remaining Lifetime (MRL) and component Birnbaum's measure of structural importance (I B) to save preventive setup costs. Moreover, the complex structures allow to economize corrective setup costs by grouping some CM actions with the PM actions at τ. The CM grouping is performed by leaving some failed units in idle state until the next PM period. This action can economize corrective setup costs, but it also leads a change of the system structure during the system operation. Therefore, in this paper, a simulation method using Monte Carlo Simulation is developed to analyze the changes of system structure during the system operation and calculate the average maintenance cost. A numerical example of a 6 components system is finally introduced to illustrate the use and the advantages of the proposed strategy when compared to existing methods. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London..",,1,0,,,,undefined,

Usually we don't have really observed 'real' failures, but we think a failure occurs once the system degradation index reaches a preset failure level. From this view, the failure level defines the failure when considering boundary-crossing failures. This point is emphasized in this paper and we want to reproduce the failure level based on inverse first passage problem (IFPT). Besides those technical results in this paper, an interesting conclusion is we actually have distinguished between 'real' failures and boundary-crossing failures in data analysis, and this paper provided a way to model the 'real' failures by first passage failures. The core issue discussed in this paper is called inverse first passage problem: supposing that the degradation dynamic is given whose failure is defined as first passage failure, and also the distribution of failure time is given or estimated from real data, this paper is to find the passage level under which the first passage density function is just the given distribution of failure time. Specifically, the degradation model considered in this paper is a time-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process which is verified in a real case before. Later based on a connection between the time-dependent OU process and Brownian motion, we here have derived a numerical algorithm to calculate the corresponding passage boundaries based on given first passage density. These results were tested for a fitted model where the first passage density function is initially calculated based on a given passage level, then we reproduced the same passage level based on our algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.",boundary-crossing failures | failure level | first passage time | Inverse first passage problem | stochastic degradation modeling | time-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,7,0,,,,undefined,

In the first one, the decisions are relied only on the remaining lifetime (RUL) of the units, while in the second one, they are based on both RULs of the system and its units. The RUL is associated to a conditional reliability level calculated when an opportunity occurs (i.e., at inspection times), and maintenance actions are assumed perfect (i.e., replacement). The cost models of these strategies are developed on the basis of semi-regenerative theory, and are compared with each other.

The degradation phenomenon of a system is the fatigue crack growth that is modeled by a physics-based stochastic process. The environment process is assumed to be modeled by a time-homogenous Markov chain with finite state space. We suppose that the environmental condition is observed perfectly, while the crack depth can be assessed imperfectly through a non-destructive ultrasonic technique. As such, two kinds of indirect information are available on the system at each inspection time: environmental covariate and diagnostic covariate. Based on this set of information, two condition-based maintenance strategies adaptive to environmental conditions are developed. In the first one, the adaptation scheme is time-based, while in the second, it is condition-based. These maintenance strategies are compared one with another and to a classical non-adaptive one to point out the performances of each adaptation scheme and hence the appreciation of using different information sources in maintenance decision making. © 2012 IMechE.",Adaptive maintenance decision | diagnostic covariate | environmental covariate | fatigue crack growth | indirect condition monitoring | maintenance cost model | particle filter,34,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Assessment of residual lifetime of component is always taken as one of important tasks of prognostic. In the framework of prognostic, the non-probabilistic approaches are mostly considered because of their connection to the scientific community that first developed the research area corresponding to the prognostic problem and started it from a very operational point of view. However, more and more probabilistic approaches such as hidden Markov model, life cycle data analysis, proportional hazards models, etc. have been applied to prognostic. In this paper, a probabilistic approach is considered where a lifetime distribution or a stochastic process is associated to the sys tem or component under consideration. This study considers the simulated noisy observations set corresponding to a Gamma process with additive Gaussian noise which is associated to the deterioration phenomenon. The presence of the Gaussian noise is due to the noisy and irregularly sampled observations data. In order to propose a remaining useful lifetime estimation, first by a stochastic filtering with Gibbs sampler the hidden degradation state is estimated. Since this latter evolves according to a gamma process, based on the gamma process properties the remaining useful life distribution is calculated. The interest of our probabilistic method is pointed out. © 2012 IEEE.",,28,0,,,,undefined,

Two age-based maintenance policies with age-based minimal repairs and degradation-based minimal repairs are modeled, and their performance is compared with a classical pure age-based replacement policy without minimal repairs. Numerical results show the cost saving of the maintenance policies and allow us to make some conclusions about their performance under different situations of system characteristic and maintenance costs. It is shown that carrying out minimal repairs is useful in many situations to improve the performance of maintenance operations.

While dynamic reliability provides a more efficient and realistic way to perform probabilistic risk assessment than static approaches, its industrial level applications are still limited. Factors contributing to this situation are the inherent complexity of the theory and the lack of a generic platform. More recently the increased use of digital-based systems has also introduced additional modelling challenges related to specific interactions between system components. Typical examples are the intelligent transmitters which are able to exchange information, and to perform internal data processing and advanced functionalities. To make a contribution to solving these challenges, the mathematical framework of dynamic reliability is extended to handle the data and information which are processed and exchanged between systems components. Stochastic deviations that may affect system properties are also introduced to enhance the modelling of failures. A formalized Petri net approach is then presented to perform the corresponding reliability analyses using numerical methods.

When the length of the crack reaches a given threshold, the system fails. The length of the crack is modeled using a gamma process. Furthermore, when the number of cracks detected in the system attains a fixed value, the system fails. Corrective maintenance actions are performed after a system failure. A preventive maintenance is performed when the age of the system is T. Maintenance actions replace the system by a new one with an associated cost. The problem is to determine an optimal planned replacement time T, minimizing the expected cost rate of the system. The analytical solution to the problem is obtained under some general assumptions.

Coherent results can then be obtained by expressing probabilities according to input information. However, if uncertainties in parameters (e.g. failure rates) and models (e.g. relationships between events) lead to high uncertainty in results, the latter may not be robust enough to be helpful. It is therefore necessary to perform uncertainty analyses and, in order to handle both parameter and model uncertainties in a fault tree framework, a continuous gate denoted the 'C-gate' is proposed. By acting on 'weights', it is then allowed to continuously graduate model part structures between parallel and series. C-gates can also be translated into equivalent fault trees, using fictitious events, so that classical reliability tools are used to perform reliability evaluations with both parameter (failure rates) and model (through the weights) uncertainty analyses. An application on a new technology-based transmitter shows that results can be obtained with relatively low uncertainty and, in some cases, even with lower variances than any of the inputs. These properties are discussed and tend to demonstrate that the lack of knowledge on the structures of some parts of the model can be handled and partially compensated for by the proposed fault tree approach to perform PRA.",Fault tree analysis | Model uncertainty | Parameter uncertainty | Probabilistic risk assessment | Subjectivism | Uncertainty analysis,9,0,,,,undefined,

Classically, the testing schemes are either staggered (alternation of tests on redundant components) or non-staggered (all components are tested at the same time). In reality, periodic tests schemes performed on safety components are more complex and combine staggered tests, when the plant is in operation, to non-staggered tests during maintenance and refueling outage periods of the installation. Moreover, the CCF parameters estimators described in the US literature are derived in a consistent way with US Technical Specifications constraints that do not apply on the French Nuclear Power Plants for staggered tests on standby components. Given these issues, the evaluation of CCF parameters from the operating feedback data available within EDF implies the development of methodologies that integrate the testing schemes specificities. This paper aims to formally propose a solution for the estimation of CCF parameters given two distinct difficulties respectively related to a mixed testing scheme and to the consistency with EDF's specific practices inducing systematic non-simultaneity of the observed failures in a staggered testing scheme. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper an importance measure, called the multidirectional sensitivity measure, is considered; it is defined as the derivative of the performance in the direction of one parameter in the direction of a group of parameters (failure and repair rates of components, for example), or in any direction of the transition rates of a Markovian system. It is really a directional derivative in the direction of a vector in the appropriate space. There is a homotopy on the matrices that acts on the parameter space. This contrasts with the approach through components, and is less dependent on the structure or interaction of components than classical Birnbaum importance factors. This importance measure proposed for sensitivity analysis of steady state reliability is developed herein for the transient state. It is also extended and applied to the study of the production capacity of multistate production systems such as manufacturing, production lines, and power generation, which exhibit performances that can settle on different levels depending on the operative conditions of the constitutive components. A simple numerical example is introduced to show why this measure provides an efficient tool to investigate not only the importance of a given component, but also the importance of a class of components, the importance of the maintenance and, more generally, the effect of the simultaneous change of several design parameters. © 2008, Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

The safety analysis of such systems is of prime importance to avoid catastrophic consequences or even the loss of human life. In general, the various hazards that any equipment may encounter are considered without any safety functions. Later on, each hazard is studied using methods such as the risk matrix to quantify the associated risk. These methods determine which safety integrity level (SIL) needs to be implemented in order to reduce this risk to a tolerable one. Once this safety target is evaluated, an architecture is chosen during the design phase of the safety system. The standard IEC61508 states the requirements for safety systems to verify if the implemented functions reach these targets. For instance, Part 2 suggests a non-prescriptive method to merge different safety subsystems in order to achieve one with a higher SIL than those supplied by these subsystems. During the design of a SIS, the SIL selection is a very critical phase because often this system is the last line of protection against hazardous events. Even if this method is just informative, using it as a guide to follow may be an easy shortcut to label products with a dedicated safety degree. This merging method seems not to be based on an analytical method and for this reason the present paper investigates its robustness by starting from a multiphase Markovian approach. It consists in dividing the study window time of a system in phases in which a Markovian modelling is available.

In this paper an importance factor, called multi-directional sensitivity measure, defined as the derivative of the performance in the direction of one parameter, in the direction of a group of parameters (failure and repair rates of components for example), or in any direction of the transition rates of a Markovian system is considered. This importance factor proposed for sensitivity analysis of steady state reliability is developed herein for the transient state. It is also extended and applied to the study of the production capacity of multi-state production systems, such as e.g. manufacturing, production lines, which exhibit performances that can settle on different levels depending on the operative conditions of the constitutive components. A simple numerical example is introduced to show why this factor provides an efficient tool to investigate not only the importance of a given component, but also the importance of a class of components, the importance of the maintenance, and, more generally, the effect of the simultaneous change of several design parameters. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group.",,3,0,,,,undefined,

The application cases studied in this paper for Electricité de France (EDF) concern SCC on the secondary side of steam generator tubing and SCC of primary water tubes of alloy 600 in pressurized water reactors (PWR). The aim of this paper is to investigate the use of stochastic processes to model the initiation times of the cracks and their propagation. The operating feedback data given by EDF indicates that the components are periodically inspected and that one can have for one crack, the inspection date at which the crack is detected for the first time, and the measure of one propagation length (i.e. one degradation increment) after the detection time for each crack or for the largest of them. Hence, this data-set is very poor and makes it difficult (with only one degradation increment) to build a reliable propagation model (Comby 1997). An improvement proposed in this paper is to use the information contained in the detection times of each crack to estimate jointly the initiation/propagation model parameters. Numerical results are obtained with simulated data. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group.",,28,0,,,,undefined,

The definition of the hazard rate process existing with perfect monitoring is extended to the realistic case where the units failure time are not always detected (non-detection events). The so defined observed hazard rate process gives a better representation of the system behavior than the classical failure rate calculated without any information on the units state and than the hazard rate process based on perfect monitoring information. The quality of this representation is, however, conditioned by the monotony property of the process. This problem is mainly discussed and illustrated on a practical example (two parallel units). The results obtained motivate the use of the observed hazard rate process to characterize the stochastic behavior of the multi-unit systems and to optimize for example preventive maintenance policies. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the paper is to investigate if there are cases for which a simpler policy than those of (N, n)-type can be sufficient in terms of maintenance cost. A second approach proposed in literature (derived from the time-based block replacement one) is simpler but not sufficient in any situations. Some numerical experiments and an analysis of the stochastic behavior of the two-identical components system allows us to propose a third policy (Policy P). This third maintenance plan is simplified from the second one. It compensates for its weak point which is to be very expensive when the cost of replacement for one component is close to the cost of replacement for both components. Moreover it is possible to generalize this third policy from a two-identical components system to a n-identical components system.
