The resulting papers are first analyzed through a meta-data and bibliometric analysis, in which the trend of publication growth, important publication sources and authors, collaboration among the authors are identified. The evolution of research topics in three time periods (prior to mid-1990s, mid-1990s - 2010 and 2010 - present) is also discussed through a semantic clustering. Then, the most important papers from the literature search are chosen for a content analysis and critical review. The main results of the critical literature review include: First, we summarize the dependent failure behavior in different system hierarchies, i.e., failure mechanism level, component level, system level and systems-of-systems level. In each level, the main dependent failure behavior from literature is discussed with examples. Second, we develop a classification framework for the dependent failure behavior models. The most frequently-used models in each category are critically reviewed, based on which we identify five challenging problems the current dependency models face, give our perspectives on their possible solutions, and discuss future research opportunities.",Dependent failure behavior | Reliability | Risk,0,0,,,EDF,undefined,Orange

These novel applications, on the other hand, bring new challenges to network resilience. Among them, traffic variation is one of the most vital threats to the 5G network. With tens of thousands of devices connected to the network, network service resilience is threatened by the heavy traffic change induced by the end users or malicious attacks. While long timescale traffic variation can be easily predicted based on historical data, short timescale abnormal traffic is hard to forecast yet can significantly violate the service requirements. The impact of short timescale traffic variation can be mitigated by 5G management and control systems. However, the complexity and dynamics of the virtualized 5G system make it hard to estimate its resilience. This paper provides a 5G network model that captures the data traffic changes and network dynamic management mechanism. The model is able to evaluate the performance of different network services with different requirements under traffic variation events. We analyze the effectiveness of auto-scaling and compare different isolation strategies for traffic congestion.

In case of failures due to natural events, random disturbances, or deliberate attacks, the design of the coupling interface is a key factor for maintaining high performance within the interdependent CIs. However, in the existing literature, the issue of the coupling interface design is often addressed through heuristics. In this work, we propose an optimization-based mathematical approach for designing coupling interfaces between interdependent critical infrastructures under random failures.

In this paper, we therefore develop probabilistic RUL prognostics using Convolutional Neural Networks. These prognostics are further integrated into maintenance planning, both for single and multiple components. We illustrate our approach for aircraft turbofan engines. The results show that the optimal replacement time for the engines is close to the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval of the RUL estimates. We also show that our proposed maintenance approach leads to a cost reduction of 53% compared to a traditional Time-based maintenance strategy. Moreover, compared with the ideal case when the true RUL is known in advance (perfect RUL prognostics), our approach leads to a limited number of failures.

Traditional PF is a recursive Bayesian filtering framework that updates the posterior probability density function of RULs when new observation data become available. In engineering practice, due to the limited accuracy of monitoring/inspection techniques, the observation data available for PF are inevitably imprecise and often need to be treated as interval data. In this article, a novel Interval Particle Filtering (IPF) approach is proposed to effectively leverage such interval-valued observations for RUL prediction. The IPF is built on three pillars: (i) an interval contractor that mitigates the error explosion problem when the epistemic uncertainty in the interval-valued observation data is propagated; (ii) an interval intersection method for constructing the likelihood function based on the interval observation data; and (iii) an interval kernel smoothing algorithm for estimating the unknown parameters in the IPF. The developed methods are applied on the interval-valued capacity data of batteries and fatigue crack growth data of railroad tracks.

Most of the existing works on selective maintenance assumed that after each mission, the components’ states can be precisely known without additional efforts. In engineering scenarios, the states of the components in a system need to be revealed by inspections that are usually inaccurate. Inspection activities also consume the limited resources shared with maintenance activities. We, thus, put forth a novel decision framework for selective maintenance of partially observable systems with which maintenance and inspection activities will be scheduled in a holistic and interactively sequential manner. As the components’ states are partially observable and the remaining resources are fully observable, we formulate a finite-horizon Mixed Observability Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) model to support the optimization. In the MOMDP model, both maintenance and inspection actions can be interactively and sequentially planned based on the distributions of components’ states and the remaining resources. To improve the solution efficiency of the MOMDP model, we customize a Deep Value Network (DVN) algorithm in which the maximum mission success probability is approximated. A five-component system and a real-world multi-state coal transportation system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is shown that the probability of the system successfully completing the next mission can be significantly increased by taking inspections into account.

To achieve a rational result, experts from different areas should be involved, and the uncertainties in their assessments should be properly addressed. Such information is often referred to as multisource imprecise information (MSII) and might contain high degree of conflicts, as different experts usually have different expertise and knowledge. Properly quantifying the conflicts among the MSII, then, becomes a critical issue, as the subsequent processing of MSII (e.g., combination and calibration), depends on the degree of conflict in the MSII. To this end, a new conflict measure is put forth based on the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) to quantify and visualize the conflict in the MSII from a group of experts. In the first place, the MSII from each expert is used to construct the basic belief assignment (BBA) of the reliability estimates for the corresponding expert under the DST. A 2-D conflict measure, which combines the conflict factor and Jousselme distance in DST, is, then, proposed to measure the conflict between the experts' BBAs. The conflict is quantified from two perspectives, viz., mutual conflict and total conflict. Finally, a Bhattacharyya distance-based method is developed to further quantify the informativeness of each expert's MSII to the system reliability estimate.

In fact, DRO allows protecting the decision-maker from the ambiguity arising from the imprecisely identified probability distributions of the failure scenarios. In this framework, the probability distribution of the failure scenarios is assumed to be known ambiguously, and contained in an ambiguity set defined by moment-based conditions.

Grid control is even more critical during extreme events as the WAC function is required to orchestrate the response to contingencies and enhance the power system resilience through failure localization, isolation, and service restoration. Both power and telecommunication domains are involved in control applications, giving rise to multiple cyber-physical interdependencies. This paper proposes a resilience-based optimization of the distribution service restoration (DSR) by coordinating strategies of crew dispatch and manual/remote switches operation. The telecommunication service and underlying infrastructure are identified as main enablers of the co-optimization as all considered resilience strategies communicate with the control center that collects crisis management information. Therefore, the availability of telecom points in terms of power supply is examined in this work. Failure propagation in the coupled power-telecom network is highlighted, and differences in failure propagation between overhead and underground power lines are explored. The proposed approach is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, evaluated under a multi-feeder interdependent power-telecom test network. Results show that combined scheduling of resilience strategies as well as prioritization of power supply to telecom points-of-interest, yield an enhanced recovery strategy.",Distribution Service Restoration | Extreme Event | MILP | Resilience | Wide Area Control,0,1,repositoryam,Green,EDF,undefined,Orange

These systems are usually modeled as multiperformance multistate systems (MPMSSs). However, existing MPMSS models fail to consider an important aspect, i.e., the performance conversion process. For example, in a combined heat and power (CHP) generating unit, apart from the output heat and electricity, decision-makers are also interested in the unit's capacity to convert gas into electricity and heat. The latter is related to the performance conversion process. This article proposes a framework for the reliability evaluation of performance conversion-based MPMSS. In the proposed MPMSS model, the couplings among different types of performances inside the components are quantified into the multistate performance conversion matrix. The performance conversion structure functions are proposed to derive system performance conversion capability based on the conversion capabilities of the components. Two reliability evaluation methods considering the steady-state performance conversion process and the continuous-time performance conversion process are proposed, respectively.

In real-life cases, engineers need to design an optimal MSSPS structure by combining different versions and number of redundant components. The objective of the design is to ensure reliability requirements using the least costs, which could be formulated as a redundancy optimization problem under reliability constraints. The genetic algorithm is one of the most frequently used method for solving redundancy optimization problems. In traditional genetic algorithms, the population size needs to be determined based on the experience of the modeler. Often, this ends up creating a large number of unnecessary samples. As a result, the computational burden can be huge, especially for large-scale MSSPS structures. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an optimal structure designing method named as redundancy ordinal optimization. The universal generating function technique is applied to evaluate the reliabilities of the MSSPSs. Based on the reliabilities, an ordinal optimization algorithm is adapted to update the parent populations and the stopping criterion of genetic algorithm, so that the unnecessary structure designs can be eliminated.

A multistate resilience model is developed based on a Markov reward process model, where the degradation and recovery of system performance are characterized by a continuous time discrete state Markov chain and the losses caused by the extreme event is modeled by the reward rates associated with the sojourns in the degradation states and the transitions among the states.

Thus, screening of the optimal MSWKNS structure is meaningful and critical. Moreover, the system reliability becomes an increasingly important factor that should be assessed in structure screening. However, when facing a large-scale MSWKNS whose number of states is enormous, exact reliability evaluation can be rather complicated. Meanwhile, due to the large number of system structure designs, the computational burden of screening can be very huge. To effectively select the optimal structure among enormous MSWKNSs under reliability constraint, an optimal structure screening method named as ordinal structure screening (OSS) is proposed. Ordinal optimization (OO) algorithm is adopted with a novel utilization of continuization discretization approximation (CDA) method. To shorten the reliability evaluation time, CDA is employed to approximate reliabilities. Based on the approximate reliabilities, OO is applied to reduce the number of system structures to be evaluated, which accelerates the screening process.

In the meantime, with the expansion of the Internet, a lot of customers give their feedbacks on the products by posting reviews on websites. This constitutes a huge, easily accessible, and more realistic database that can be used to assess reliability. In this work, we scraped reviews from a famous e-commerce website. Machine learning models are developed to extract failure-related information from these reviews. Two kinds of information are examined in this study: (1) whether a review reports a failure and, in such a case, (2) the severity of the failure.

The majority of European railway networks are electrified, and power transmission networks represent usually the main power supplier. Railway and power networks share thus a unidirectional interdependency, as the railway network functionality depends on the power network. Due to this interdependency, failures in power networks have the potential of causing vast disruption in the dependent railway networks. Despite this, the issue of modeling interdependent railway and power networks has not been addressed sufficiently carefully in the existing literature. Furthermore, the treatment of cascading failures in power networks and their consequences in railway networks is limited and approximative. In this work, we propose a modeling framework which accounts for more realistic assumptions on the interconnections topology and the cascading failures dynamics. Firstly, we model the interconnections between the railway and external power network by introducing the traction power network, which acts as a bridge between the external power grid and the railway network. Secondly, we model cascading failures in the external and traction power networks with an approach based on the DC power flow model. Thirdly, we suggest a simple approach to estimate the negative consequences on the railway network due to load shedding in the traction power network. Vulnerability analysis is performed to estimate the negative consequences in the railway network due to different failure scenarios in the external power network. Sensitivity analysis on the initial assumptions is also performed.",Cascading failures | Critical infrastructures | Interdependent networks | Power network | Railway network | Vulnerability,1,0,,,EDF,undefined,Electricité de France

Modern CIs rely on the fifth generation of mobile communication (5G) paradigm to incorporate new technologies, deliver new sophisticated services and adopt new business models. These models will shift the CI interdependencies towards a new dynamic paradigm where communication resources are deployed within the CIs operational scheme to reach performance and quality of service (QoS) objectives. Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Network Slicing (NS) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) are examples of 5G-enabling technologies used to reach the aforementioned objectives. However, due to the complex nature of CIs and the interdependencies between their components, the shift toward a dynamic operational scheme will increase the vulnerability and exposure to risks, impacting the network resilience. This requires the design of new resilience frameworks that consider the heterogeneity, privacy and self-interest nature of CIs and guarantee reliability and QoS objectives in such a constrained and dynamic environment. To tackle the resilience problem, we propose a framework to dynamically coordinate and manage the deployment of communications resources, based on NFV. This framework will ensure the availability of services, meet performance objectives during disruptive events and overcome constraints of interdependencies and heterogeneity. To illustrate our approach, we formulate the case of maintenance operations as a disruptive event in ICT hosting SG services.",5G | Critical Infrastructure | Ict | Nfv | Optimization | Qos | Resilience | Smart Grid,1,0,,,,undefined,

These safety barriers, although designed to operate in different phases of the accidents evolution, are often optimized separately, without considering their collective effects on preventing disruptions and quickly recovering from the disruptions. This paper develops a joint optimization model for synthetically optimizing safety barriers of different natures, including prevention, mitigation, emergency and recovery barriers to enhance the business continuity of the NPP, considering the threat of steam generator tube rupture (SGTR) accidents. The joint optimization is guided by a business continuity metric called expected business continuity value (EBCV). A physics-of-failure model is developed to describe the crack growth process of the steam generator tube and to model the effect of the prevention barriers, i.e., periodical inspection of the crack length. An event tree model is developed to describe the evolution of the SGTR-initiated accident and to model the effect of the mitigation and emergency barriers. Recovery measures are also considered via a widely-used logarithmic function model. A mixed-integer genetic algorithm (MIGA) is used to obtain optimal solutions of the joint optimization model.

In the present paper, we develop an extended framework for the analysis of the criticality of assumptions in risk assessment by evaluating the risk that deviations from the assumptions lead to a reduction of the safety margins. The framework aims to support risk-informed decision making by identifying important assumptions and integrating the assessment of their criticality into the quantitative risk assessment (QRA). The framework is, finally applied within the quantitative risk assessment of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) exposed to external flooding. Compared to previous works on the subject, we consider also conservative assumptions and introduce decision flow diagrams to support the classification of the criticality of the assumptions.

Most of the existing resilience quantification methods assume that the performance level of the system is continuous. A lot of practical energy systems, however, are multistate in nature or needs to be modeled by multistate models to control the modelling/computational complexity (Levitin, 2011). There are only a few works regarding quantifying resilience using multistate models. Thekdi and Chatterjee (2019) developed a multistate hidden Markov model to quantify resilience of infrastructure systems and discussed decision making based on the model. Nuss et al. (2017) used a continuous time discrete state Markov model to quantify the resilience against disruptions considering the multistate engineering system behaviors of unmanned surface vessels to support system design selection during trade studies. In a previous research of the authors (Du et al., 2019), a Markov reward process-based model is developed for quantifying resistant, absorption, recovery and overall resilience. All the above mentioned works are based on Markov (or hidden Markov) models. A significant drawback of these Markov model-based methods is that they have to assume that the transition times among states follow exponential distributions. Practical systems, however, exhibit a variety of time-dependent behaviors, which cannot be adequately described using only exponential distributions. In this paper, we develop a Semi-Markov reward process-based approach to quantify resilience of multistate systems, considering the time-dependent behaviors of both the pre-disruption protection processes and the post-disruption recovery processes. Four numerical metrics are defined to quantify resilience based on the developed model.

On the other hand, condition monitoring is more and more adopted in industry to maintain under control the state of components and systems. On this basis, in this work, a dynamic and quantitative method is proposed to integrate in BCA the information on the conditions of components and systems. Specifically, a particle filtering-based method is developed to integrate condition monitoring data on the safety barriers installed for system protection, to predict their reliability as their condition changes due to aging. An installment model and a stochastic price model are also employed to quantify the time-dependent revenues and tolerable losses from operating the system.

The DCFP considered comprises of soft failure processes due to degradation and hard failure processes due to random shocks, where dependency arises due to the abrupt changes to the degradation processes brought by the random shocks. In practice, random shock processes are often unobservable, which makes it difficult to accurately estimate the shock intensities and predict the RUL. In the proposed method, the problem is solved recursively in a two-stage framework: in the first stage, parameters related to the degradation processes are updated using particle filtering, based on the degradation data observed through condition monitoring; in the second stage, the intensities of the random shock processes are updated using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, considering the dependency between the degradation and shock processes, and the fact that no hard failure has occurred. The updated parameters are, then, used to predict the RUL of the system.

To address this issue, we develop a dynamic risk assessment (DRA) method that allows online estimation of risk indexes using data collected during operation. Two types of data are considered: statistical failure data, which refer to the counts of accidents or near misses from similar systems and condition-monitoring data, which come from online monitoring the degradation of the target system of interest. For this, a hierarchical Bayesian model is developed to compute the reliability of the safety barriers and a Bayesian updating algorithm, which integrates particle filtering (PF) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo, is developed to update the reliability evaluations based on both the statistical and condition-monitoring data. The updated safety barriers reliabilities, are, then, used in an event tree (ET) for consequence analysis and the risk indexes are updated accordingly. A case study on a high-flow safety system is conducted to demonstrate the developed methods. A comparison to the DRA method which only uses statistical failure data shows that by introducing condition-monitoring data on the system degradation process, it is possible to capture the system-specific characteristics, and, therefore, provide a more complete and accurate description of the risk of the target system.",Condition-monitoring | dynamic risk assessment (DRA) | event tree (ET) analysis | hierarchical Bayesian model | Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) | particle filtering (PF),56,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Most existing CCF models assume that the component failure behavior does not vary over time. Such an assumption is often challenged in practice due to the influence of various degradation mechanisms, e.g., wear, corrosion, fatigue, etc. In this paper, we develop a new model for CCFs considering components degradation. The model is developed in the mathematical framework of Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS). The CCFs are modeled as random shock processes that affect a group of components simultaneously and the components degradation processes are modeled by stochastic differential equations derived from physics-of-failures. The benefit of using the SHS model for CCFs is that the developed model is analytically solvable. The system reliability can, then, also be solved analytically in closed form. The proposed CCF modelling framework is demonstrated by a numerical example of a three-unit redundant system and, then, applied to an Auxiliary Feedwater Pump (AFP) system of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). A comparison to the Binomial Failure Rate (BFR) model of literature shows that by considering the components degradation processes, the proposed model can accurately describe the CCF effect on the reliability of a system with degrading components.",Binomial failure rate model | Common-cause failures | Component degradation | Monte Carlo simulation | Random shocks | Stochastic hybrid systems,30,0,,,NSFC,61573043,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Evaluating such designs through conventional life tests is difficult as the affordable test time is too short to generate a meaningful amount of failure data. In this paper, we design and implement an accelerated life test (ALT) for evaluating the reliability of pneumatic cylinders. From a detailed analysis of failed samples from field operation, the major failure mechanisms that affect the reliability of pneumatic cylinders are identified, e.g., wear and tear of sealing rings. For these failure mechanisms, temperature and frequency are found out to be the significant stresses of the pneumatic cylinders. A two-factor-four-level full-factor design of ALT is, then, performed to set up an ALT plan for the pneumatic cylinders. A total number of 95 samples are tested according to the ALT plan, and a mixed Arrhenius-inverse-power-law model is used to fit the test data and predict the reliability under normal operation conditions. In addition, a normal stress test of eight samples is performed to validate the reliability predicted by the ALT. The results show that using the proposed ALT, the reliability of the pneumatic cylinder can be predicted with satisfactory accuracy.

The assessment is, then, formulated as a classification problem, solved by a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) constructed based on a set of training data, whose trustworthiness is given by experts. NBC learns the expert's assessment from the training data: therefore, once constructed, the NBC can be used to assess the trustworthiness of QRAs other than the training data.

Then, interactions among failure mechanisms are modeled as a combination of three basic relations, competition, superposition and coupling. This is the reason why the method is referred to as “compositional method”. Finally, the PoF models and the interaction model are combined to develop a deterministic model of the dependent failure behavior. As a demonstration, the method is applied on an actual spool and the developed failure behavior model is validated by a wear test.

In practice, however, due to the limited resource, it is often hard to estimate the precise values of the parameters in the MDCFP model. Hence, the predicted reliability is affected by epistemic uncertainty. Probability box (P-box) is applied in this paper to describe the effect of epistemic uncertainty on MDCFP models. A dimension-reduced sequential quadratic programming (DRSQP) method is developed for the construction of P-box. A comparison to the conventional construction method shows that DRSQP method reduces the computational costs required for P-box constructions. Since epistemic uncertainty reflects the unsureness in the predicted reliability, a decision maker might want to reduce it by investing resource to more accurately estimate the value of each model parameter. A two-stage optimization framework is developed to allocate the resource among the parameters and ensure that epistemic uncertainty is reduced in a most efficient way.

The degradation processes are described by stochastic differential equations, whereas transitions between the system discrete states are triggered by random shocks. The modeling is, then, based on Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS), whose state space is comprised of a continuous state determined by stochastic differential equations and a discrete state driven by stochastic transitions and reset maps. A set of differential equations are derived to characterize the conditional moments of the state variables. System reliability and its lower bounds are estimated from these conditional moments, using the First Order Second Moment (FOSM) method and Markov inequality, respectively. The developed framework is applied to model three dependent failure processes from literature and a comparison is made to Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate that the developed framework is able to yield an accurate estimation of reliability with less computational costs compared to traditional Monte Carlo-based methods.",,15,1,repositoryam,Green,CSC,201606020082,China Scholarship Council

The prediction capability heavily influences the decision makers' attitude toward taking the risk of using the predicted remaining useful life to inform the maintenance decisions. In this article, a four-layer, top-down, hierarchical decision-making framework is proposed to assess the prediction capability of prognostic methods. In the framework, prediction capability is broken down into two criteria (Layer 2), six sub-criteria (Layer 3) and 19 basic sub-criteria (Layer 4). Based on the hierarchical framework, a bottom-up, quantitative approach is developed for the assessment of the prediction capability, using the information and data collected at the Layer-4 basic sub-criteria level. Analytical hierarchical process is applied for the evaluation and aggregation of the sub-criteria and support vector machine is applied to develop a classification-based approach for prediction capability assessment. The framework and quantitative approach are applied on a simulated case study to assess the prediction capabilities of three prognostic methods of the literature: fuzzy similarity, feed-forward neural network and hidden semi-Markov model. The results show the feasibility of the practical application of the framework and its quantitative assessment approach, and that the assessed prediction capability can be used to support the selection of the suitable prognostic method for a given application.",analytical hierarchical process | feed-forward neural network | fuzzy similarity | hidden semi-Markov model | prediction capability | Prognostic and health management | remaining useful life,19,0,repositoryam,Green,,61573043,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The capacity of the DG system is, then, calculated as a summation of the power generated by all the components. A MDD-based reliability evaluation algorithm is developed to calculate two reliability indexes for the DG system, i.e., Expected Energy Not Supplied (EENS) and Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE).

In this paper, we develop an integrated framework for condition-informed risk analysis. A conventional event tree model is used, in which some safety barriers are subject to degradation mechanisms and their failure probabilities are treated as time-dependent. Particle Filtering (PF) is used to update the failure probabilities of the safety barriers in real-time, based on the collected condition-monitoring data. The updated failure probabilities are, then, used in the event tree model. The developed framework also allows predicting the scenario probabilities in the future. To do this, the failure probabilities are updated and predicted by PF and, then integrated in the event tree.

The developed SHS-based DCFP model considers soft failures caused jointly by continuous degradation and additional abrupt degradation increment due to random shocks, and hard failures caused by sudden overload from the same shock processes.

Business Continuity Management (BCM) is a way to integrate the recovery process within the preventive framework of risk assessment. Such integrated risk management strategy offers great potential benefits. However, the complexity of applying it in practice is such that existing BCM strategies are mainly based on qualitative methods only, which limits the potential added values. To support quantitative BCM, in this paper we define a set of quantitative business continuity metrics. The defined metrics are based on the estimated losses incurred by the disruptive event in the whole business process. For this, the business process is divided into four sequential phases, i.e., protection phase, mitigation phase, emergency phase and recovery phase. For each phase, a specific modeling method is developed and an integrated modeling framework is constructed for the business continuity. Simulation can, then, be used to quantify the business continuity metrics.
