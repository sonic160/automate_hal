However, an imbalance may exist among different degradation states, because of the specific data size and/or the interest of the practitioners on the different degradation states. Specifically, reliable equipment may experience long periods in low-level degradation states and small times in high-level ones. Then, the conventional trained models may result in overfitting the low-level degradation states, as their data sizes overwhelm the high-level degradation states. In practice, it is usually more interesting to have accurate results on the high-level degradation states, as they are closer to the equipment failure. Thus, during the training of a data-driven model, larger error costs should be assigned to data points with high-level degradation states when the training objective minimizes the total costs on the training dataset. In this paper, an efficient method is proposed for calculating the costs for continuous degradation data. Considering the different influence of the features on the output, a weighted-feature strategy is integrated for the development of the data-driven model.

The prediction can be made in one-step and multi-step ahead. For predictive maintenance, multi-step-ahead prediction is of interest for projecting the evolution of the future conditions of the equipment of interest, computing the remaining useful life and taking corresponding maintenance decisions. Recursive prediction is one of the popular strategies for multi-step-ahead prediction. SVM is a popular data-driven approach that has been used for recursive multi-step-ahead prediction. Tuning the hyperparameters in SVM during the training process is challenging, and normally the hyperparameters are tuned by solving an optimization problem. This paper analyses the possible objectives of the optimization for tuning hyperparameters. Through experiments on one synthetic dataset and two real time series data, related to the prediction of wind speed in a region and leakage from the reactor coolant pump in a nuclear power plant, a bi-objective optimization combining mean absolute derivatives and accuracy on all prediction steps is shown to be the best choice for tuning SVM hyperparameters for recursive multi-step-ahead prediction.",Bi-objective optimization | Hyperparameters tuning | Recursive multi-step-ahead prediction | Single-objective optimization | Support vector machine,32,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The assessment is, then, formulated as a classification problem, solved by a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) constructed based on a set of training data, whose trustworthiness is given by experts. NBC learns the expert's assessment from the training data: therefore, once constructed, the NBC can be used to assess the trustworthiness of QRAs other than the training data.

This article presents a general framework for the assessment of power system vulnerability to malicious attacks. The concept of susceptibility to an attack is employed to quantitatively evaluate the degree of exposure of the system and its components to intentional offensive actions. A scenario with two agents having opposing objectives is proposed, i.e., a defender having multiple alternatives of protection strategies for system elements, and an attacker having multiple alternatives of attack strategies against different combinations of system elements. The defender aims to minimize the system susceptibility to the attack, subject to budget constraints; on the other hand, the attacker aims to maximize the susceptibility. The problem is defined as a zero-sum game between the defender and the attacker. The assumption that the interests of the attacker and the defender are opposite makes it irrelevant whether or not the defender shows the strategy he/she will use. Thus, the approaches “leader–follower game” or “simultaneous game” do not provide differences as far as the results are concerned. The results show an example of such a situation, and the von Neumann theorem is applied to find the (mixed) equilibrium strategies of the attacker and of the defender.",Intentional attacks | power systems | susceptibility | vulnerability | zero-sum game,9,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Three steps comprise the developed method. First, physics-of-failure (PoF) models are utilized to model each failure mechanism. Then, interactions among failure mechanisms are modeled as a combination of three basic relations, competition, superposition and coupling. This is the reason why the method is referred to as “compositional method”. Finally, the PoF models and the interaction model are combined to develop a deterministic model of the dependent failure behavior. As a demonstration, the method is applied on an actual spool and the developed failure behavior model is validated by a wear test.

When the equipment experiences variable operating conditions, individual data-driven prognostic models are not able to accurately predict the remaining useful life during the entire equipment life. The objective of this work is to develop an ensemble approach of different prognostic models for aggregating their remaining useful life predictions in an adaptive way, for good performance throughout the degradation progression. Two data-driven prognostic models are considered, a homogeneous discrete-time finite-state semi-Markov model and a fuzzy similarity-based model. The ensemble approach is based on a locally weighted strategy that aggregates the outcomes of the two prognostic models of the ensemble by assigning to each model a weight and a bias related to its local performance, that is, the accuracy in predicting the remaining useful life of patterns of a validation set similar to the one under study. The proposed approach is applied to a case study regarding a heterogeneous fleet of aluminum electrolytic capacitors used in electric vehicle powertrains.

MDCFPs have been well studied in literature and various models have been developed to predict the reliability of MDCFPs. In practice, however, due to the limited resource, it is often hard to estimate the precise values of the parameters in the MDCFP model. Hence, the predicted reliability is affected by epistemic uncertainty. Probability box (P-box) is applied in this paper to describe the effect of epistemic uncertainty on MDCFP models. A dimension-reduced sequential quadratic programming (DRSQP) method is developed for the construction of P-box. A comparison to the conventional construction method shows that DRSQP method reduces the computational costs required for P-box constructions. Since epistemic uncertainty reflects the unsureness in the predicted reliability, a decision maker might want to reduce it by investing resource to more accurately estimate the value of each model parameter.

Resilience is defined in this work as the capacity of a system to absorb the impacts of perturbations and recover quickly from disruptive states. It is seen as a property of the system, which depends on a number of design, operation, and control parameters. Within this framework, we introduce the concept of resilience regions in the parameters space: as long as the parameters values remain inside these regions during operation, the system visits only recoverable states or, in other words, it maintains nominal operation or recovers quickly to it. Based on this concept, we perform a resilience analysis of two interconnected critical infrastructures, a gas network and an electric power system. The analysis is performed by numerical calculation of the resilience conditions in terms of design, operation, and control parameters values for given failure scenarios. To render computationally feasible analysis, we resort to an abstract representation of the system dynamics by a linear model of switching dynamics. Although the high-level modeling adopted may suffer from predictive accuracy, the proposed framework can still provide valuable insights in the analysis of system resilience and its dependence on the design, operation, and control parameters under different failure scenarios, which can be valuable to inform the decision making process of CIs operators and other stakeholders.",,37,0,,,,undefined,

Feature vector selection can largely reduce the data size and, thus, the computational burden. The constructed model is a modified version of the least square SVM, in which a higher cost is assigned to the error of classification of faulty conditions than the error of classification of normal conditions. The proposed framework is successfully validated on a number of public unbalanced datasets. Then, it is applied for the fault detection of braking systems in HST: in comparison with several SVM approaches for unbalanced datasets, the proposed framework gives better results.",Braking system | Classification | Cost-sensitive models | Feature vector selection | High speed train | Highly imbalanced data | Support vector machine | Threshold optimization,101,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In recent years, data-driven approaches have been proposed and implemented to tackle the problem, e.g., neural networks, fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy approaches, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor classifiers and inference methodologies. Among these methods, dynamic uncertain causality graph (DUCG) has been proved effective in many practical cases. However, the causal graph construction behind the DUCG is complicate and, in many cases, results redundant on the symptoms needed to correctly classify the fault. In this paper, we propose a method to simplify causal graph construction in an automatic way. The method consists in transforming the expert knowledge-based DCUG into a fuzzy decision tree (FDT) by extracting from the DUCG a fuzzy rule base that resumes the used symptoms at the basis of the FDT. Genetic algorithm (GA) is, then, used for the optimization of the FDT, by performing a wrapper search around the FDT: the set of symptoms selected during the iterative search are taken as the best set of symptoms for the diagnosis of the faults that can occur in the system. The effectiveness of the approach is shown with respect to a DUCG model initially built to diagnose 23 faults originally using 262 symptoms of Unit-1 in the Ningde NPP of the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corporation. The results show that the FDT, with GA-optimized symptoms and diagnosis strategy, can drive the construction of DUCG and lower the computational burden without loss of accuracy in diagnosis.",Classification | Dynamic uncertain causality graph | Fault diagnosis | Fuzzy decision tree | Genetic algorithm | Nuclear power plant,16,0,,,,undefined,

In this article, a four-layer, top-down, hierarchical decision-making framework is proposed to assess the prediction capability of prognostic methods. In the framework, prediction capability is broken down into two criteria (Layer 2), six sub-criteria (Layer 3) and 19 basic sub-criteria (Layer 4). Based on the hierarchical framework, a bottom-up, quantitative approach is developed for the assessment of the prediction capability, using the information and data collected at the Layer-4 basic sub-criteria level. Analytical hierarchical process is applied for the evaluation and aggregation of the sub-criteria and support vector machine is applied to develop a classification-based approach for prediction capability assessment. The framework and quantitative approach are applied on a simulated case study to assess the prediction capabilities of three prognostic methods of the literature: fuzzy similarity, feed-forward neural network and hidden semi-Markov model.

To this aim, the classical simulation-based Monte Carlo (MC) approaches may be impractical, due to the fact that (i) power networks typically have very large reliabilities, so that cascading failures are rare events and (ii) very large computational expenses are required for the resolution of the cascading failure dynamics of real grids.

In this paper, we develop an integrated framework for condition-informed risk analysis. A conventional event tree model is used, in which some safety barriers are subject to degradation mechanisms and their failure probabilities are treated as time-dependent. Particle Filtering (PF) is used to update the failure probabilities of the safety barriers in real-time, based on the collected condition-monitoring data. The updated failure probabilities are, then, used in the event tree model. The developed framework also allows predicting the scenario probabilities in the future. To do this, the failure probabilities are updated and predicted by PF and, then integrated in the event tree.

In this work, we propose MSPM to describe the degradation dynamics of a piping system, accounting for the dependence on the size and location of the Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) initiating event of the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) of a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). Estimated frequencies of LOCA as a function of break size are used in a variety of regulatory applications and for the Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). Traditionally, two approaches have been used to assess LOCA frequencies as a function of pipe break size: estimates based on statistical analysis of field data collected from piping systems service experience and Probabilistic Fracture Mechanics (PFM) analysis of specific, postulated, physical damage mechanisms. However, due to the high reliability of NPP piping systems, it is difficult to construct a comprehensive service database based on which perform statistical analysis. On the other hand, it is difficult to utilize PFM models for calculating LOCA frequencies because many of the input variables and model assumptions are over-simplified and may not adequately represent the true plant conditions. We overcome these challenges and propose a size- and location-dependent LOCA initiating event frequencies estimation by resorting to the novel MSPM modeling scheme. Benchmarking is done with respect to the results obtained with the Generic Safety Issue (GSI) 191 framework that makes use of field data for LOCA initiating event probability calculation.",,6,0,,,,undefined,

In CPSs, cyber and physical processes are dependent and interact with each other: sensors, actuators, communication and computational units are all interconnected to realize functionalities of real-time monitoring, dynamic control and decision support, for normal operation as well as in case of accidents. However, an emerging concern is that the use of computer-based technologies might increase the exposure to failures and accidents, providing new channels for their initiation and propagation. System integrity can be, indeed, affected by hardware component failures, human errors, communication malfunctions and software errors, but also compromised by security breaches and cyber attacks. In practice, these latter could be confused with random components failures on-demand and malfunctions, misjudging their actual nature of malicious cyber attacks and, thus, leading to wrong counteractions. In this study, we analyze and model stochastic failures in components of CPSs, with the purpose of estimating reference values of failure on-demand probabilities and malfunction rates. Considering these as true values, then, significant difference with statistical estimates from field data collected on the real CPS can be used to detect malicious attempts at altering the safety of a NPP.

The risk index proposed takes into account these correction costs as well as the cost of the energy not served due to the failure, while considering an oligopolistic behavior of the generation companies. A 3-stage model is proposed to simulate the bidding behavior in the market, under different line failures scenarios. The risk index proposed and the method for its calculation are applied on an adapted IEEE 6-bus reliability test system.

To address it, risk analysts often rely on Bow Tie diagrams, which are useful to model the system accident scenarios and appreciate the effects of safety barriers that prevent and mitigate the associated risks. However, the current approach to safety barrier selection and positioning is mainly based on what-if analyses, through which the analysts, based on their experience, add barriers throughout the Bow Tie diagram until the risk of severe accident decreases beyond the given threshold. This way, the set (i.e., portfolio) of barriers finally installed may be not cost-efficient. To overcome this limitation, in this paper we frame the barrier selection issue within the Portfolio Decision Analysis: the goal is supporting the decision maker to identify the portfolios of safety barriers for a given Bow Tie scheme, which are optimal with respect to system residual risk, reliability and investment costs, also accounting for budget limitations and barrier feasibility constraints. The optimization algorithm used to find the optimal portfolios is based on implicit enumeration, which keeps small the computational burden in case of a limited number of alternative safety barriers.

Business Continuity Management (BCM) is a way to integrate the recovery process within the preventive framework of risk assessment. Such integrated risk management strategy offers great potential benefits. However, the complexity of applying it in practice is such that existing BCM strategies are mainly based on qualitative methods only, which limits the potential added values. To support quantitative BCM, in this paper we define a set of quantitative business continuity metrics. The defined metrics are based on the estimated losses incurred by the disruptive event in the whole business process. For this, the business process is divided into four sequential phases, i.e., protection phase, mitigation phase, emergency phase and recovery phase. For each phase, a specific modeling method is developed and an integrated modeling framework is constructed for the business continuity. Simulation can, then, be used to quantify the business continuity metrics. The developed methods are applied to assess the business continuity of an oil storage tank farm.",Business continuity management | Event consequence diagram | Event tree | Oil storage tank farm | Risk analysis | Semi-Markovian model,40,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In this complex context, one of the major concerns is that related to the potentially catastrophic consequences of cascading failures triggered by rare and difficult to predict extreme weather events. In this work, we originally propose to combine an extreme weather stochastic model of literature to a realistic cascading failure simulator based on a direct current (DC) power flow approximation and a proportional re-dispatch strategy. The description of the dynamics of the network is completed by the introduction of a novel restoration model accounting for the operating conditions that a repair crew may encounter during an extreme weather event. The resulting model is solved by a customized sequential Monte Carlo scheme in order to quantify the impact of extreme weather events on the reliability/availability performances of the power grid.

An empirical classification model is developed, based on the Majority Rule Sorting method, to evaluate the class of criticality of the plant/system of interest, with respect to safety. The model is built on the basis of a (limited-size) set of data representing the characteristics of a number of plants and their corresponding criticality classes, as assigned by experts. The construction of the classification model may raise two issues. First, the classification examples provided by the experts may contain contradictions: a validation of the consistency of the considered dataset is, thus, required. Second, uncertainty affects the process: a quantitative assessment of the performance of the classification model is, thus, in order, in terms of accuracy and confidence in the class assignments. In this paper, two approaches are proposed to tackle the first issue: the inconsistencies in the data examples are “resolved” by deleting or relaxing, respectively, some constraints in the model construction process. Three methods are proposed to address the second issue: (i) a model retrieval-based approach, (ii) the Bootstrap method and (iii) the cross-validation technique.

Including these additional features within an overarching framework can render the analysis infeasible in practical cases, due to the high dimension of the system state-space and the computational effort correspondingly needed to explore the possible system evolutions in search of the interesting (and very rare) ones of failure. To tackle this hurdle, in this article we introduce a framework for efficiently probing the space of event sequences of a dynamic system by means of a guided Monte Carlo simulation. Such framework is semi-automatic and allows embedding the analyst's prior knowledge about the system and his/her objectives of analysis. Specifically, the framework allows adaptively and intelligently allocating the simulation efforts preferably on those sequences leading to outcomes of interest for the objectives of the analysis, e.g., typically those that are more safety-critical (and/or rare). The emerging diversification in the filling of the state-space by the preference-guided exploration allows also the retrieval of critical system features, which can be useful to analysts and designers for taking appropriate means of prevention and mitigation of dangerous and/or unexpected consequences.

Unacceptable computational burden with large datasets and difficulty in tuning hyperparameters are usually the drawbacks of kernel methods. In order to reduce the computational burden, this paper presents a modified version of the Feature Vector Selection (FVS) method, proposing an approximation of the estimate function as a weighted sum of the predicted values of the Feature Vectors (FVs), where the weights are computed as the oblique projections of the new data points on the FVs in the feature space. Such approximation is, then, obtained by optimizing only the predicted values of the FVs. By defining a least square error optimization problem with equal constraints, analytic solutions of the predicted values of the FVs can be obtained. The proposed method is named Feature Vector Regression (FVR). The tuning of hyperparameters in FVR is also explained in the paper and shown to be less complicated than for other kernel methods. Comparisons with some other popular kernel methods for regression on several public datasets show that FVR, with a small subset of the training dataset (i.e. selected FVs), gives results comparable with those of the methods which give best results in terms of the prediction accuracy. The main contribution of this paper is the new kernel method (i.e. FVR), capable of achieving satisfactory results with reduced efforts because of the small number of hyperparameters to be tuned and the reduced training dataset size used.",Computational complexity | Feature Vector Regression | Feature vector selection | Hyperparameters tuning | Kernel method | Prediction | Regression,9,0,,,,undefined,

A main difficulty is that the fleet of equipment typically experiences different operating conditions, which influence both the condition monitoring data and the degradation processes that physically determine the RUL. We propose an approach for RUL estimation from heterogeneous fleet data based on three phases: firstly, the degradation levels (states) of an homogeneous discrete-time finite-state semi-markov model are identified by resorting to an unsupervised ensemble clustering approach. Then, the parameters of the discrete Weibull distributions describing the transitions among the states and their uncertainties are inferred by resorting to the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method and to the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), respectively. Finally, the inferred degradation model is used to estimate the RUL of fleet equipment by direct Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The proposed approach is applied to two case studies regarding heterogeneous fleets of aluminium electrolytic capacitors and turbofan engines. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting the RUL and its superiority compared to a fuzzy similarity-based approach of literature.",Aluminium electrolytic capacitors | Failure prognostics | Heterogeneous fleet | Homogeneous discrete-time finite-state semi-markov model | Remaining Useful Life (RUL) | Turbofan engines,60,0,repositoryam,Green,EC,71231001,European Commission

Like all data-driven methods, under non-stationary environmental and operational conditions it needs to be provided with adaptive learning capabilities, which might become computationally burdensome with large datasets cumulating dynamically. In this paper, a cost-efficient online adaptive learning approach is proposed for SVR by combining Feature Vector Selection (FVS) and Incremental and Decremental Learning. The proposed approach adaptively modifies the model only when different pattern drifts are detected according to proposed criteria. Two tolerance parameters are introduced in the approach to control the computational complexity, reduce the influence of the intrinsic noise in the data and avoid the overfitting problem of SVR. Comparisons of the prediction results is made with other online learning approaches e.g. NORMA, SOGA, KRLS, Incremental Learning, on several artificial datasets and a real case study concerning time series prediction based on data recorded on a component of a nuclear power generation system.

By so doing, IA's economic and environmental performances can be improved. Despite recent methodological advancements, the existing approaches to EIP design optimization are still suffering from several major problems: (i) dominance of the global EIP optimum over the local IA optimum, (ii) limited number of optimization objectives falling into the categories of economic and environmental objectives and (iii) EIP optimization performed without considering possible operational uncertainties. In addition, the adoption of the bio-inspired concept of IS makes EIP evolve from classical engineered systems towards complex engineered systems, with associated static and dynamic complexity characteristics. To highlight and understand the complexity features of EIP, in this paper we present them as intelligent networks for multiple energy and material exchanges, drawing a parallel with another typical complex system, that of the electric power network, in its modern Smart Grid (SG) concept, conceived to improve and optimize the distribution and use of electrical energy. Then, the modelling and optimization framework proposed in this paper adopts a more systematic methodology for accounting of the EIP complexity characteristics and addressing the associated optimization challenges.

A non-sequential MCS-OPF (Monte Carlo simulation and optimal power flow) computational model is developed to emulate the network operation by generating random scenarios from the diverse sources of uncertainty, and assess the system performance in terms of CG (global cost). To measure uncertainty in the system performance, we introduce the DCVaR (conditional value-at-risk deviation) which, due to its axiomatic relation to the CVaR (conditional value-at-risk), allows the conjoint control of risk. A MOO strategy can, then, be adopted for the concurrent minimization of the ECG (expected global cost) and the associated deviation DCVaR(CG).

In practice, the TH model response is affected by uncertainties (both epistemic and aleatory), which make the limit-state function and the failure domain probabilistic. The present paper sets forth an innovative approach to identify the failure domain together with the safest plant operating conditions. The approach relies on the use of Reduced Order Models (ROMs) and K-D Tree.

The farthest point from the failure boundary is, then, computed by means of a K-D Tree-based nearest neighbor algorithm; this point represents the combination of input values corresponding to the safest operating conditions.

As for any energy equipment, reliability is the fundamental attribute that needs to be guaranteed. A number of studies have been carried out for wind turbine reliability assessment. Most of them model the wind turbine system as a whole, without investigating its interior structure and failure logic. In this paper, a modeling and simulation framework is proposed for the reliability assessment of generic geared wind turbine systems. It is based on a Goal Tree, Success Tree and Master Logic Diagram for modeling the relationships among components and functions in a wind turbine system, and the impact of factors and mechanisms influencing the failure of the components. The modeling framework is customized to represent the strength of the relationships and the uncertainty of the impact of failures of these components on other components and functions. The model is eventually integrated in a Monte Carlo simulation framework for the computation of the wind turbine system reliability. Finally, model validation is performed by comparing the simulation results with those obtained by a Bayesian network model developed for this purpose. •We propose a reliability model and simulation framework for wind turbine system.•We consider the logic relationships among different components in the system.•The GTST-MLD approach is used to develop the model for reliability evaluation.•A simulation framework is developed for the quantification of the model.•The proposed framework is validated by comparing with Bayesian network modeling.",Goal tree | Master logic diagram | Monte carlo simulation | Reliability | Success tree | Wind turbine,45,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In this paper, we address the problem of automatically and efficiently probing the space of the event sequences in a dynamic system. In particular, an entropy-driven technique is proposed for intelligently focusing the exploration efforts preferably on those scenarios that are most interesting for the scope of the analysis. To this aim, the relevance of a given accident scenario is defined by two original indicators: (i) the criticality of the corresponding system end states, related to their (un)likelihood of occurrence and/or their (extreme) consequences; (ii) the level of “unexpectedness” of the corresponding event sequences, with respect to the prior knowledge of the analyst.

EIP deployment is driven by several potential benefits, i.e., improvement of IAs operational performance (increase of end product output), improvement of IAs economic indicators (increase of revenues) and decrease of IAs exposure to external risks (leading to energy/material supply shutdowns). However, gain of these benefits depend on IAs internal and operational conditions, and other factors. Then, the opportunity of EIP deployment must be evaluated, going through the description of these conditions and factors, and the modelling of their influence on the potential benefits, in order to arrive at optimal choices of deployment. In practice, several uncertainties exist in both the description of conditions and factors, and in the modelling of their impact on the EIP. In order to address the above aspects, methodological contributions are required in (i) modelling and developing of a realistic case study and (ii) optimization, both in presence of uncertainty. This paper addresses the modelling direction and aims at developing an industrial case study for Eco-Industrial Park (EIP) deployment, under uncertainty.

In the reliability model, the wear process is described by a linear degradation process and the clamping stagnation is modeled as a shock process, described by a non-homogeneous Poisson process. The model accounts for the interactions between the two failure mechanisms, by assuming that the rate of occurrence of the shocks depends on the degradation level of the spool valve.

The computational effort associated to this approach can be prohibitive because of the large number of lengthy T-H code simulations necessary for the accurate and precise quantification of the (typically small) failure probability. To overcome this issue, in the present paper we propose an Adaptive Meta-model-Based Subset Importance Sampling (AM-SIS) approach that originally and efficiently combines the powerful features of several advanced computational methods of literature: in particular, Subset Simulation (SS) and fast-running Artificial Neural Network (ANN) meta-models are coupled within an adaptive MC- based Importance Sampling (IS) scheme. The objective is to construct a fully nonparametric estimator of the ideal, zero-variance Importance Sampling Density (ISD) and iteratively refine it, in such a way that: (i) the accuracy and precision of the corresponding failure probability estimates are improved and (ii) the number of burdensome T-H code runs is reduced, along with the associated computational cost. The method is demonstrated on a case study of an emergency passive decay heat removal system of a Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR).
