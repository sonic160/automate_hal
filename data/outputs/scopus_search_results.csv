Countries have shown different preparedness levels for promptly implementing disease detection strategies, via mass testing and isolation of identified cases, which led to a largely varying impact of the outbreak on the populations and health-care systems. In this paper, we propose a new pandemic resource allocation model for allocating limited disease detection and control resources, in particular testing capacities, in order to limit the spread of a pandemic. The proposed model is a novel epidemiological compartmental model formulated as a non-linear programming model that is suitable to address the inherent non-linearity of an infectious disease progression within the population. A number of novel features are implemented in the model to take into account important disease characteristics, such as asymptomatic infection and the distinct risk levels of infection within different segments of the population. Moreover, a method is proposed to estimate the vulnerability level of the different communities impacted by the pandemic and to explicitly consider equity in the resource allocation problem. The model is validated against real data for a case study of COVID-19 outbreak in France and our results provide various insights on the optimal testing intervention time and level, and the impact of the optimal allocation of testing resources on the spread of the disease among regions.

For this reason, recently few studies have started to investigate the vulnerability of a highly coupled traffic-power system in the presence of disruptive events. Actually, however, only very few of these studies have considered the impact of EVs on the interdependent traffic-power system during restoration from a disruptive event. In an attempt to fill this gap, in this study, we investigate the restoration planning of both independent RNs and PNs, and interdependent traffic-power systems. A mixed integer program model is formulated to provide optimal reconfiguration and operational solutions for post-disruption traffic-power systems recovery. The objective of the model is to minimize the total cost incurred by system performance loss, which is quantified by the cumulative unmet traffic demand for RNs and load shedding cost for PNs. Several reconfiguration strategies are considered, including links reversing in RNs and line switching in PNs, to optimize system resilience. In the proposed model, the integrated problem of system optimal dynamic traffic assignment and optimal power flow is solved to derive the optimal traffic-power flow. RNs and PNs are coupled through the coordinately allocated spatio-temporal charging demand of EVs. A partial highway network in North Carolina (NC), USA, and a modified IEEE-14 bus system are used to illustrate the application of the model.

This may bring new stresses and risks to such a system of systems. This paper presents a mathematical framework to analyze the resilience of an electrified road network (ERN) subject to potential failures of its supporting fast-charging stations (FCSs). Within this framework, a novel linear optimization model is proposed for the first time to solve the system optimal dynamic traffic assignment problem of ERN. The characteristics considered in the modeling framework include the location, capacity, and charging speed of FCSs, as well as the driving range, charging time, and state of charge (SoC) of EVs. The linear model is proposed based on the cell transmission model. It is used as the first-stage model to assign the traffic under normal FCS operations. A second-stage model is, then, extended to minimize the total travel time after the stochastic occurrence of FCS failures, that is, in the failure and recovery phases. Two metrics are considered to quantify the ERN performance and the impacts of FCS failures. A numerical example is studied to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework for analyzing ERN resilience.

If these situations are not considered, it will lead to large fluctuations in estimated SOC and accumulation of estimated errors at continuous time steps To solve these problems, an estimator combining multichannel convolutional and bidirectional recurrent neural networks (MCNN-BRNN) is proposed for SOC estimation. Specifically, MCNN can extract multiscale local robust features that are invariant to perturbations from measurements on different input paths reducing the estimation fluctuations and enhancing the robustness of the estimator. Moreover, a global convolutional layer is designed to learn the intercorrelations of multiscale features and preserve their temporal coherence. By this means, BRNN can capture the effective time-varying information of intercorrelated features in the forward and reverse directions to sequentially estimate SOC, thus alleviating the error accumulation and improving the overall estimation accuracy.

The uncertainty of electricity demand and renewable power generation is taken into account through bounded intervals, with parameters that permit control over the level of conservatism of the solution. The multistage robust optimization model allows the sequential representation of uncertainty realization as they are revealed over time. It also guarantees the non-anticipativity of future uncertainty realizations at the time of decision-making, which is the case in practical real-world applications, as opposed to two-stage robust and stochastic models. To render the resulting multistage robust problem tractable, decision rules are employed to cast the uncertainty-based model into an equivalent mixed integer linear (MILP) problem. The re-formulated MILP problem, while tractable, is computationally prohibitive even for moderately sized systems. We, thus, propose a solution method relying on the reduction of the information basis of the decision rules employed in the model, and validate its adequacy to efficiently solve the problem.

Firstly, scenarios in the transportation network of NY State, e.g. of reduced capacity and incident, are generated by a Monte Carlo non-sequential algorithm. Then, the cell transmission model (CTM) is used to simulate the evolution of the traffic flows under such scenarios. This allows evaluating the spatial-temporal EV charging loads in different areas of the electrified transportation system of NY State.

In this study, a reliability analysis framework for Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) is developed, based on the concept of Integrated Deterministic and Probabilistic Safety Analysis (IDPSA). A bi-directional energy conversion system model is developed to simulate the deterministic evolution of the IES. Then, the dynamic event tree (DET) analysis technique is used to describe the stochastic evolution of IES, based on the physics of IES. Given the scenarios from the DET, the probabilistic safety margin method is used to evaluate the reliability of IES. The contract pressures at delivery points are adopted as critical safety parameters for the evaluation of the safety margins. To reduce the computational burden, Order Statistics, combining the Bracketing and Coverage approaches, are used to obtain the percentiles of the probabilistic distribution of the safety parameters. An application of the developed framework is performed on an IES. The results indicate that the framework can evaluate the reliability of IES from the perspectives of dynamic failure probability and operation performance. Furthermore, the impact of P2G (power to gas) on the energy supply and operation security of the IES is analysed in detail.",Dynamic event tree | Integrated energy systems | Reliability | Safety margin,11,0,,,NSFC,51134006,National Natural Science Foundation of China

For mathematical tractability, most approaches rely either on the consideration of specific maintenance strategies, e.g. Periodic Inspection and Replacement (PIR), whose defining parameters are optimized, or on time-and-space-state discretization using Markov Decision Process (MDP) models and resolution through policy iteration. In both cases, optimality may be hard to guarantee. In this paper, the decision-theoretic concept of Value of Information (VoI) is used as a metric to guide resource prioritization in time, that is, to schedule inspections in a piecewise optimal manner. An aperiodic sequential inspection policy is proposed, where the determination of the next best time for inspection, or replacement, is based on the current condition and on the computed expected gain from possible inspections, i.e. on a VoI metric. This policy can be implemented when the current condition is known from imperfect inspection or processing of condition-monitoring data. Also, more generally, a discussion is proposed on the use of VoI as a guide for information collection in life-cycle management.",Condition-Based maintenance | Imperfect information | Inspection planning | Maintenance optimization | Renewal theory | Sequential decision-making | Value of information,37,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Then, the confidence that can be put in its outcomes is fundamental, and this depends on the accuracy, representativeness and completeness of the models used in the risk assessment. A quantitative measure is needed to assess the credibility and trustworthiness of the outcomes obtained from such models, for decision-making purposes. This article proposes a four-level, top-down, hierarchical tree to identify the main attributes and criteria that affect the level of trustworthiness of models used in risk assessment. The level of trustworthiness (Level 1) is broken down into two attributes (Level 2), three sub-attributes and one “leaf” attribute (Level 3), and seven basic “leaf” sub-attributes (Level 4). Based on this hierarchical decomposition, a bottom-up, quantitative approach is employed for the assessment of model trustworthiness, using tangible information and data available for the basic “leaf” sub-attributes (Level 4). Analytical hierarchical process is adopted for evaluating and aggregating the sub-attributes, and Dempster–Shafer theory is adopted to consider the uncertainty and the inconsistency in the experts’ judgments. The approach is applied to a case study concerning the modeling of the residual heat removal system of a nuclear power plant, to compute its failure probability. The relative trustworthiness of two mathematical models of different complexity is evaluated: a fault tree and a multi-states physics-based model. The trustworthiness of the multi-states physics-based model is found to outweigh that of the fault tree model, which can be explained by the fact that multi-states physics-based model takes into account the components failure dependency relations and degradation effects. The feasibility and reasonableness of the approach are, thus, demonstrated, paving the way for its potential applicability to inform decision-making on safety-critical systems.",analytical hierarchical process | Dempster–Shafer theory | fault tree | model trustworthiness | multi-states physics-based model | nuclear power plant | Risk-informed decision-making,1,0,,,,undefined,

This paper develops a joint optimization model for synthetically optimizing safety barriers of different natures, including prevention, mitigation, emergency and recovery barriers to enhance the business continuity of the NPP, considering the threat of steam generator tube rupture (SGTR) accidents. The joint optimization is guided by a business continuity metric called expected business continuity value (EBCV). A physics-of-failure model is developed to describe the crack growth process of the steam generator tube and to model the effect of the prevention barriers, i.e., periodical inspection of the crack length. An event tree model is developed to describe the evolution of the SGTR-initiated accident and to model the effect of the mitigation and emergency barriers. Recovery measures are also considered via a widely-used logarithmic function model. A mixed-integer genetic algorithm (MIGA) is used to obtain optimal solutions of the joint optimization model.

In the present paper, we develop an extended framework for the analysis of the criticality of assumptions in risk assessment by evaluating the risk that deviations from the assumptions lead to a reduction of the safety margins. The framework aims to support risk-informed decision making by identifying important assumptions and integrating the assessment of their criticality into the quantitative risk assessment (QRA). The framework is, finally applied within the quantitative risk assessment of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) exposed to external flooding. Compared to previous works on the subject, we consider also conservative assumptions and introduce decision flow diagrams to support the classification of the criticality of the assumptions. The framework provides a more comprehensive and transparent evaluation of the assumptions deviation risk through the decision flow diagrams that facilitate the standardization of the evaluation of the assumption deviation effects on the risk assessment.",Assumption deviation | Conservative assumption | Decision flow diagram | External flooding | Nuclear power plants | Quantitative risk assessment | Strength of knowledge,9,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

The Stuxnet, which destroyed Iran's uranium enrichment facility in 2010, suggests that NPPs could even lead to an accident involving the release of radioactive materials cyber-attacks. However, cyber security research on industrial control systems (ICSs) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems is relatively inadequate compared to information technology (IT) and further it is difficult to study cyber-attack taxonomy for NPPs considering the characteristics of ICSs. The advanced research of cyber-attack taxonomy does not reflect the architectural and inherent characteristics of NPPs and lacks a systematic countermeasure strategy. Therefore, it is necessary to more systematically check the consistency of operators and regulators related to cyber security, as in regulatory guide 5.71 (RG.5.71) and regulatory standard 015 (RS.015). For this reason, this paper attempts to suggest a template for cyber-attack taxonomy based on the characteristics of NPPs and exemplifies a specific cyber-attack case in the template. In addition, this paper proposes a systematic countermeasure strategy by matching the countermeasure with critical digital assets (CDAs). The cyber-attack cases investigated using the proposed cyber-attack taxonomy can be used as data for evaluation and validation of cyber security conformance for digital devices to be applied, and as effective prevention and mitigation for cyber-attacks of NPPs.",Cyber security | Cyber-attack taxonomy | ICS | Nuclear power plant | SCADA,22,1,repositoryvor,Green,MOTIE,20171510102100,"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy"

However, the estimation errors of the predictor parameters (e.g., the magnitude and VS30) are generally not accounted for in the development of GMPEs. In the present study, the uncertainty in the magnitude-and site-related parameters is considered in the establishment of GMPEs by ANNs. For this, an algorithm is proposed based on the generalized least-squares principle applied to ANNs training. A simulated database is used to validate the approach and to demonstrate the effect of the input parameter uncertainties on the GMPEs. Finally, the proposed model is applied to the Reference database for seismic ground motion in Europe (RESORCE) data-base.

Specifically, agents involved in the resilience management aim at an optimum process of sequential preparedness/protection, emergency response, recovery, and adaptation activities, trading off the loss due to lack of system functionality with the needed investment. Agents' decisions are made sequentially aiming at minimizing the overall system loss in the presence of numerous uncertainties in the intensity of the disruption, post-disruption demand, repair durations, etc. We restrict the actions to only depend on uncertain parameters realized up to the current decision period. This process can be formulated as a multi-stage optimization problem. We discuss how the linear decision rule approximation can be used to overcome the curse of the computational complexity of the problem and to derive operationally implementable policies. By referring to a simple example of a notional infrastructure, we demonstrate that the proposed approach helps providing a holistic view of resilience management and deriving optimal actions and policies for resilience enhancement.",Infrastructure systems | Multistage decision making | Resilience management,2,0,,,,undefined,

In this respect, business continuity management (BCM) has been proposed as a comprehensive and proactive framework to prevent the disruptive events from impacting the business operations and reduce their potential damages. Most existing business continuity assessment (BCA) models that numerically quantify the business continuity are time-static, in the sense that the analysis done before operation is not updated to consider the aging and degradation of components and systems which influence their vulnerability and resistance to disruptive events. On the other hand, condition monitoring is more and more adopted in industry to maintain under control the state of components and systems. On this basis, in this work, a dynamic and quantitative method is proposed to integrate in BCA the information on the conditions of components and systems. Specifically, a particle filtering-based method is developed to integrate condition monitoring data on the safety barriers installed for system protection, to predict their reliability as their condition changes due to aging. An installment model and a stochastic price model are also employed to quantify the time-dependent revenues and tolerable losses from operating the system. A simulation model is developed to evaluate dynamic business continuity metrics originally introduced.

In this paper, it is shown that the change in system performance at time t, and consequently the importance of the parameters at time t, depends on the parameters perturbation time and their value functions during the system mission time. We consider a nonhomogeneous continuous time Markov model of a series-parallel system to propose the mathematical proofs and simulations, while the ideas are also shown to be consistent with general models having nonexponential failure rates.

Resilience against extreme weather is also becoming an important concern. In this study, a modeling and optimization framework for power systems planning, which considers both operational flexibility and resilience against extreme weather events, is proposed. In particular, a set of piece-wise linear models are developed to capture the impact of extreme heat waves and drought events on the performance of the power generation units and on the system load. A method is, also, proposed to incorporate the impact models within a modified optimal power system planning problem that can adequately accommodate high shares of IRES. The framework is applied to a case study based on real future climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) under different levels of IRES penetration (up to 50%) and severity of the extreme weather events. A sensitivity analysis is conducted for planning under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) that cover the impact of different trajectories of greenhouse gas concentration on future climate. In particular, RCPs with increase in radiative forcing of +8.5 Wm-2, +4.5 Wm-2 and +2.6 Wm-2 of the pre-industrial levels are considered. The results demonstrate that significant improvements in terms of load supply under an extreme heat wave and drought events can be achieved following the resilient planning framework proposed, compared to conventional planning methods. It is also shown how renewable generation units can improve the system performance against those extreme climate events. Moreover, the quantitative assessment indicates an important interaction between the resilience of the system and its flexibility, and the compound impact of failing to consider either aspect in the power system design phase.",Extreme weather events | Operational flexibility | Power system design | Power system resilience | Renewable energy penetration,51,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In this framework, the potential impacts of a specific natural hazard on an infrastructure are first evaluated in terms of failure and recovery probabilities of system components. Then, these are fed into a bi-level attacker–defender interdiction model to determine the critical components whose failures lead to the largest system functionality loss. The proposed framework bridges the gap between the difficulties of accurately predicting the hazard information in classical probability-based analyses and the over conservatism of the pure attacker–defender interdiction models. Mathematically, the proposed model configures a bi-level max-min mixed integer linear programming (MILP) that is challenging to solve. For its solution, the problem is casted into an equivalent one-level MILP that can be solved by efficient global solvers.

Hence, early identification of anomalies is vital in guaranteeing reliable and safe transportation. However, most of the existing early fault diagnosis methods can only estimate the degradation trend under a specific fault mode. How to analyze the diversified degradation conditions under multiple fault modes is still a key problem. Considering the diversity of fault modes, this study proposes an early fault diagnosis method based on self-organizing feature map network and support vector machine, focusing on the use of non-fault data to simultaneously mine and accurately identify degradation states under different fault modes, to provide guidance for proactive machine maintenance. The experimental results obtained via application of this scheme to field data for railway point machines demonstrate that the proposed methodology can effectively mine and accurately identify degradation states with different machine characteristics.",Degradation state identification | Degradation state mining | Early fault diagnosis | Railway point machine | Self-organizing mapping | Support vector machine,34,0,repositoryam,Green,NSFC,41402020502,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The DCFP considered comprises of soft failure processes due to degradation and hard failure processes due to random shocks, where dependency arises due to the abrupt changes to the degradation processes brought by the random shocks. In practice, random shock processes are often unobservable, which makes it difficult to accurately estimate the shock intensities and predict the RUL. In the proposed method, the problem is solved recursively in a two-stage framework: in the first stage, parameters related to the degradation processes are updated using particle filtering, based on the degradation data observed through condition monitoring; in the second stage, the intensities of the random shock processes are updated using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, considering the dependency between the degradation and shock processes, and the fact that no hard failure has occurred. The updated parameters are, then, used to predict the RUL of the system. Two numerical examples are considered for demonstration purposes and a real dataset from milling machines is used for application purposes.

They are inherently large- scale dynamic systems with a high degree of spatio-temporal complexity. Their reliability and security of supply are central considerations in any regional or global energy-related policy. Methods for power systems planning have typically ensured key operational reliability aspects under normal operating conditions and in response to anticipated demand variability, uncertainty and supply disruptions, e.g. due to errors in load forecasts and to unexpected generation units outages. Solutions have been commonly built on capacity adequacy and operating reserves requirements, among others. However, recent objectives for environmental sustainability and the threats of climate change are challenging the reliability requirements of power systems in various new ways and necessitate adapted planning methods. The present chapter describes some of the issues related to the development of the integrated techno-economic modeling and robust optimization framework that is needed today for power systems planning adapted. Such planning framework should cope with the new context by addressing the challenges associated with the sustainability targets of future power systems, and most notably ensuring operational flexibility against the variability of renewable energy sources, ensuring resilience against extreme weather events and ensuring robustness against the uncertainties inherent in both the electric power supply and system load. This chapter presents the context by summarizing the main sustainability drivers for the current (and future) power systems planning and operation. These well-known sustainability targets have become a worldwide imperative in all sectors of economic activity, and are embedded within almost any regulatory or policy dialogue. We will, then, review the particular transformation undergoing in the electric power sector planning, not only driven by the sustainability goals, but also by the more general technological and/or regulatory advancements. The main power systems planning related challenges are detailed, along with a thorough review of previous research works and research gaps. Then, key research questions and ensuing objectives are formulated.",,2,0,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

However, this opens a channel between the social network and the power grid through which malicious attackers can publish false information that can actually cause problems to the power grid. In this paper, we analyze this new problem by modeling a social network-coupled smart grid and investigating its vulnerability to false pricing attacks in the social network. The energy consumption profile based on social information is modeled as a consumption rescheduling problem, which aims to maximize the benefit of demand-side management. The false price spreading process is described by a multi-level influence propagation model, which takes into account the personalities of the end users. Different attack strategies are considered and the power operator's response is modeled. The residual ampacity of distribution lines and the expected energy not supplied are adopted to quantify the impacts of the attacks on the power system. To account for the stochastic characteristics of the influence propagation process, Monte Carlo simulation is utilized. The proposed modeling and analysis framework is applied on a modified IEEE 13 nodes test feeder and a notional social network.

The scheme has two main modules based on extreme learning machines: pre-processing and prediction. The pre-processing module uses novel single and multiple imputation techniques to estimate the missing observations. The prediction module aims to obtain precise predictions even in the presence of missing observations and with the related uncertainty. The pre-processing module sends imputed subsets of samples to the prediction module, which makes use of extreme learning machines for one-step and multi-steps predictions. The prediction module contains various multi-steps prediction strategies including iterative, direct and DirRec, which use the constant-current experimental capacity data for the long-term prediction of the remaining useful life. Accurate prediction of RUL requires continuity in the time-series dataset. The proposed scheme is designed to build an intelligent prediction system with the ability to handle time-series data containing missing values and is robust enough to generate a complete time-series dataset and, then, make short or long term predictions. The experimental results confirm that the proposed framework can be beneficial for intelligent diagnostic and prognostic systems related to battery as well as other wide range of applications.

On the other hand, it can reduce the workload and improve work efficiency. The method is traceable and easy to use.

The safety of nuclear fusion systems has to be proved and verified by a systematic analysis of the system behavior under normal transient and accidental conditions. One challenge to the analysis is that the operation of tokamaks presents complex dynamic features as it is based on the transformer principle: in particular, they employ superconducting magnets, a subset of which operates with variable current to generate one of the components of the magnetic field needed to confine the plasma in the chamber where nuclear fusion reactions occur.

We propose a methodological framework compliant with ISO 12100 to systemically carry out repeatable risk analyses in support to the design of industrial machinery in which protective measures can be introduced to reduce risk. The methodology first proposes a scheme for identifying the contribution of PMs to the reduction of risk in a machinery under design. Then, the methodology classifies the protective measures and builds a clear mapping between these classes and the risk factors they impact on. This helps decision makers to identify the protective measures guaranteeing that the residual risk is acceptable. The methodology is applied to a real case study concerning a curing machine for tyre vulcanization, where it has proven to be beneficial for the clarity of the analysis and its repeatability.",ISO 12100: 2010 | ISO/TR 14121-2: 2012 | Protective measures | Risk assessment | Risk reduction,9,0,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

A data-driven prediction method is developed from real-time data of operation pressure and gas consumption. Specifically, the deep learning method is combined with the data window method and structural controllability theory to predict the conditions of gas pipeline network components. The data window method is applied to reconstruct the data structure and build a “memory” for the deep learning method. Structural controllability theory is applied to extract critical parameters, for reducing the problem size. The developed method allows accurate and efficient predictions, especially in abnormal conditions. For demonstration, the method is applied to a complex gas pipeline network. The results show that the developed method can provide accurate real-time predictions useful for reducing potential losses in operation, and perform efficient and effective management of the gas pipeline system.

The framework is applied to a ten year planning horizon of a realistically sized case study representing the national power system of France, under several scenarios of RES penetration levels and carbon limits, spanning levels of up to 50%. The importance of incorporating the detailed short-term constraints within long-term planning models is shown. The results of the assessment show that, under high renewable energy penetration, neglecting the short-term constraints may lead to plans significantly short on flexibility, reaching shortage levels of up to 50% in frequency and several GWs in magnitude. Also, the load not served reaches levels of up to 3% and carbon emission is underestimated by up to 60%.

Generation involves simulating an as complete and realistic as possible set of accident scenarios; modeling involves representing in a structured way the simulated scenarios; post-processing involves extracting from the simulated scenarios information relevant for the safety assessment of the system, in particular, untangling the safe scenarios from the prime implicants (PIs) (minimum combinations of failure events that are capable of leading the system into a fault state) and the near misses (NMs) (combinations of failure events that lead the system to a quasi-fault state, a condition close to accident).

On the other hand, the safe operation of NPPs has become an urgent problem that the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA) must solve. To this end, NNSA established a nationalwide OEF system to improve the safety level of NPPs and strengthen the exchange of operating experience. Analyzing the human factors events (HFEs) is an important part of OEF and it is significant to improve human performance and prevent human error. Data mining has been recognized as an effective way to analyze data. With the continuous increase in operating event reports, data mining related to nuclear safety becomes a new domain of study. In this paper, we propose a data mining framework in support of the OEF system. The framework combines three statistical approaches (i.e., correlation analysis, cluster analysis and association rule mining) for identifying intrinsic correlations among human factors: correlation analysis measures the strength of linear relationship between human factors; cluster analysis classifies human factors into relevant groups; association rule mining identifies associations and causalities among human factors. For illustration, we apply the proposed framework to 162 human factors events (screened out from 313 events collected from the OEF system), and the results reflect the feasibility and effectiveness of the framework in identifying the intrinsic correlations among human factors.

Two types of data are considered: statistical failure data, which refer to the counts of accidents or near misses from similar systems and condition-monitoring data, which come from online monitoring the degradation of the target system of interest. For this, a hierarchical Bayesian model is developed to compute the reliability of the safety barriers and a Bayesian updating algorithm, which integrates particle filtering (PF) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo, is developed to update the reliability evaluations based on both the statistical and condition-monitoring data. The updated safety barriers reliabilities, are, then, used in an event tree (ET) for consequence analysis and the risk indexes are updated accordingly. A case study on a high-flow safety system is conducted to demonstrate the developed methods. A comparison to the DRA method which only uses statistical failure data shows that by introducing condition-monitoring data on the system degradation process, it is possible to capture the system-specific characteristics, and, therefore, provide a more complete and accurate description of the risk of the target system.",Condition-monitoring | dynamic risk assessment (DRA) | event tree (ET) analysis | hierarchical Bayesian model | Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) | particle filtering (PF),59,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Most existing CCF models assume that the component failure behavior does not vary over time. Such an assumption is often challenged in practice due to the influence of various degradation mechanisms, e.g., wear, corrosion, fatigue, etc. In this paper, we develop a new model for CCFs considering components degradation. The model is developed in the mathematical framework of Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS). The CCFs are modeled as random shock processes that affect a group of components simultaneously and the components degradation processes are modeled by stochastic differential equations derived from physics-of-failures. The benefit of using the SHS model for CCFs is that the developed model is analytically solvable. The system reliability can, then, also be solved analytically in closed form. The proposed CCF modelling framework is demonstrated by a numerical example of a three-unit redundant system and, then, applied to an Auxiliary Feedwater Pump (AFP) system of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). A comparison to the Binomial Failure Rate (BFR) model of literature shows that by considering the components degradation processes, the proposed model can accurately describe the CCF effect on the reliability of a system with degrading components.",Binomial failure rate model | Common-cause failures | Component degradation | Monte Carlo simulation | Random shocks | Stochastic hybrid systems,31,0,,,NSFC,61573043,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Complexity in railway systems has significantly increased due to the use of modern technologies in relation to computers, microprocessors, communication, and information technologies, in combination with the historically developed electromechanical components. The resulting inter- and intradependencies and redundancies among technologies extend the boundaries of the railway network system. Unwanted and unknown system states may emerge due to unidentified behaviors, which cannot be predicted and, thus, eliminated. It then becomes a target for the designers, operators, maintainers, and approvers to consider the acceptable limits of system states. To do so, railway-related standards have been introduced in terms of reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety (RAMS).",,18,0,,,,undefined,

Evaluating such designs through conventional life tests is difficult as the affordable test time is too short to generate a meaningful amount of failure data. In this paper, we design and implement an accelerated life test (ALT) for evaluating the reliability of pneumatic cylinders. From a detailed analysis of failed samples from field operation, the major failure mechanisms that affect the reliability of pneumatic cylinders are identified, e.g., wear and tear of sealing rings. For these failure mechanisms, temperature and frequency are found out to be the significant stresses of the pneumatic cylinders. A two-factor-four-level full-factor design of ALT is, then, performed to set up an ALT plan for the pneumatic cylinders. A total number of 95 samples are tested according to the ALT plan, and a mixed Arrhenius-inverse-power-law model is used to fit the test data and predict the reliability under normal operation conditions. In addition, a normal stress test of eight samples is performed to validate the reliability predicted by the ALT. The results show that using the proposed ALT, the reliability of the pneumatic cylinder can be predicted with satisfactory accuracy. It is also shown that the designed ALT plan requires only 38.77% of the testing effort of other conventional life tests.",Accelerated life test | data analysis | failure mechanisms | pneumatic cylinders | reliability,8,1,repositoryam,Green,CSC,201706025028,China Scholarship Council

A capacity model, superposed on the graph model, and a combination of thermal-hydraulic simulation and optimization is used to simulate the system operation under different scenarios and estimate the different supply performances of the pipelines. This allows to assess the criticality of the pipelines by the network flow method. For demonstration, the method is applied to a relatively complex gas pipeline network.

The choices of the initial value ranges and distributions of the unknown parameters in the state and observation equations influence the performance of the particle filtering approaches, in terms of convergence, speed, and stability of prognostic results. For new products with little or even no degradation process data, uniform distributions over experience-based value ranges are the most common choice for parameters initialization. In this paper, the failure times' data collected during reliability tests executed before volume production are used for defining the initial value ranges and distributions of uncertain parameters. This is expected to increase the convergence speed of the parameters estimation with monitored data and to reduce the uncertainty of the predicted remaining useful life. Numerical experiments on synthetic degradation processes of PEM fuel cells and lithium-ion batteries are considered.
