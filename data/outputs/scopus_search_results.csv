Transitions towards sustainable and people-centred urban mobility systems are paramount. Yet, this is accompanied by various challenges. Complex urban systems are accompanied by high uncertainties (e.g., technological progress, demographics, climate change) which are currently not well integrated. Possible solutions originate from design, policymaking, and innovation, with a widespread disconnection due to non-compatible methods. This paper presents a method to improve the ability to design future urban mobility systems by integrating different approaches for modelling what the future could be and who could be the users. The research question is how diverse future user needs can be integrated in design processes for urban mobility systems. The proposed scenario-based design and personas allows to create data-driven proto-personas—a set of archetypical users with assigned characteristics and behaviours—test their validity, derive distributions across geographical areas, and transform them for different 2030 scenarios. This serves as input to create full personas and synthetic populations as intermediary design objects for the collaboration of designers and simulation experts. The methodology is exemplarily applied in the context of Paris. It contributes to urban mobility solution design that is more aware of future uncertainty and diverse needs of users, therefore, better capable to respond to today’s challenges.

However, despite environmentally promising technologies in refrigeration, there are still barriers to their widespread adoption. In this paper, a generic approach able to describe the multiple performances (energy, environmental, economic, social) of refrigeration systems is proposed to assess their potential of adoption. To propose a realistic study framework, four architectures of supermarket refrigeration systems are modelled and simulated using ground data with different climatic conditions and electricity mixes (France, Sweden, Spain). The overall results of these operational scenarios show that the electricity mix is the most influential parameter on cost and environmental impact. In addition, architecture using CO2 refrigerant shows interesting performances regardless of location and despite degraded regimes during heat peaks. However, the maintenance score can be a limiting factor for installing more energy efficient systems. Two other scenarios are studied: with photovoltaic panels; with financial support. Photovoltaic panels help improving cost and environmental performances, but also strongly depend on maintenance performances. Financial support helps facilities using low-global-warming-potential refrigerant to be more competitive than those using high-global-warming-potential refrigerant.",Decision making | Design | Refrigeration | Supermarket | Sustainability,1,0,,,,undefined,

Despite this general statement, the literature still overlooks how enterprises should apply various DTs of Industry 4.0 across the entire product lifecycle to operationalize CE-related strategies. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a conceptual framework exploring DTs in terms of CE operationalization from the perspective of the product lifecycle. Based on insights gained through a systematic literature review, we clarify how DTs can facilitate CE performance objectives through the three stages of the product lifecycle: product design, product use, and product recovery or recycling. Furthermore, we study how various Industry 4.0 DTs, such as the Internet of things, big data, and cloud computing, are utilized to operationalize the transition toward a CE. DTs applied to the service-oriented product-service system contributes innovation into circular business models to make full use of idle resources and provide high-quality personalized services. We have adopted three performance objectives: using fewer materials and resources, extending product lifespan, and closing the loop to evaluate the effects of DTs in promoting CE development. By investigating how DTs affect CE performance objectives, the conceptual framework developed in this paper advances the knowledge regarding the role of DTs as an enabler of CE from the product lifecycle. Our findings provide a practical reference enabling researchers and managers to harness the potential of DTs to support CE transition.",artificial intelligence | big data | circular business model | circular economy | cloud computing | Industry 4.0 | Internet of things | product-service system | sharing economy,4,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,UNITO,undefined,Università degli Studi di Torino

To understand the potential for 3D printing at a hospital level, we report the results of an interview study in a French general hospital. We analyse the current use of 3D printing and estimate the potential for new applications. We explore what share of these applications could be internalised, and what would be the organisational implications and the key success factors for an internal 3D printing unit. We find a large untapped potential for internal production of 3D printed products, spanning a much broader range of applications and hospital departments than what currently exists in the hospital.

They can lead to multiple long-term social impacts influencing people's way of life and behaviour. So it is necessary to anticipate them without delay. Due to high uncertainty, designers may face the problem that conventional user-centred methods, which assess design performances from today's users, are not adapted. We think sociologists can help characterise the likely social impacts of future products. So we propose an original framework called the Representation-Usage-Impact (RUI) method to stimulate sociologists' projection and capture relevant knowledge about probable social impacts. The method includes a database structure encoding the knowledge of sociologists for further use in the design process. Its goal is to help designers avoid making choices today that may be regretted in decades. We illustrate the method and its process with the design of autonomous vehicle scenarios, as it will likely bring many new usages in the future. As the method is still under construction, we present an intermediate validation step involving sociologists.

To find out which characteristics of scenarios we can assess, we conducted interviews and an expert workshop. This results in a scenario assessment framework of 3 levels: Assessment of system impact, evaluation of impact on practitioners and quality assurance. We focus on the latter as it represents the key gap and established a checklist for it. We distinguish between the level of engagement, i.e., scenario makers and users who adapt existing sets (or archetypes). Finally, we provide a checklist to aid ensuring that when choosing existing scenario sets, key criteria are fulfilled. This shall enable designers to better integrate scenarios in their workflows.

We propose a co-design framework to distinguish their roles and four tools for them to better embed relevant expertise in the SG design process. A first tool is a domain decomposition model, which helps teachers create the knowledge repository for an IE methodology. Then, a specification vector is provided to define clear learning objectives. The third tool is a mapping table that inspires designers building gaming elements based on the learning objectives.

It paves the way for an ever-increasing amount of data which has become a fertile ground for growth and innovation, but also for improvements in human well-being and environmental performance. Digitalization can offer, through an enhanced knowledge of territorial resources and activities, increasing opportunities to achieve more circular economy models and thus more sustainable production and consumption systems. By contrast, many barriers can slacken the deployment of digital tools which need to be identified and tackled. The present work seeks to understand the nature of the opportunities and challenges that arise within the introduction of digitalization to promote the circular economy on a territorial level. Hence, through a systematic literature review, key issues associated with the deployment of digital tools are highlighted by emphasizing the areas of application; agriculture, transportation and energy. Subsequently, a 'Strengths, Challenges, Opportunities, Responses, Effectiveness' (SCORE) approach is adopted to investigate through a qualitative analysis the past, present and future opportunities and challenges. These findings are positioned and discussed with a key actor managing the Paris-Saclay territory and transitioning towards more circular economy practices. Finally, recommendations are made for public actors to tackle the challenges and accommodate the digital transition towards more circular territories.",circularity | decision-making support | digitalization | SCORE | smart territory,1,0,,,,undefined,

Combining life cycle assessment and life cycle costing methodologies, and by defining adequate functional units, building simulation models, and collecting life cycle inventory data, a systematic comparative study between autonomous and conventional lawn mowers is performed on their environmental and economic impacts. Through this multi-indicator analysis, environmental and economic trade-offs between the autonomous and conventional mowing solutions are quantitatively discussed for key relevant usage scenarios, from mowing an average residential yard to maintaining larger fields like a football stadium or a schoolyard. Concretely, sensitivity analyses on key parameters influencing the performance of the autonomous mower have been conducted to evaluate the environmental and economic benefits of an augmented robotic mower.

An action research approach is conducted in collaboration with an emerging international remanufacturing center of heavy handling machines to bring a contribution to this gap in a circular economy perspective. This industrial pilot study considers the entire end-of-life management of a whole heavy vehicle, from the dismantling to the recovery of used parts, through remanufacturing. It illustrates as such the multiple dimensions to consider when closing-the-loop on heavy vehicles, namely: technical and organizational knowledge (e.g., infrastructures, tooling, dismantling process and remanufacturing feasibility), as well as economic considerations (e.g., solutions to optimize the value recovered according to market needs, through the identification of potential recovery channels). To do so, a multi-scale modeling is proposed, taking into account: (i) the condition of the used vehicle and residual values of key components, (ii) the dismantling process and capabilities, (iii) the possible end-of-life options and associated market. A first dismantling operation on a worn-out 8-ton forklift truck is performed and closely analyzed to identify hotspots and areas for improvement. Based on that and taking inspiration from the best practices of the automotive recycling sector, a new dismantling process is designed including improvement in terms of organisation, resources used, disassembly time, and comfort for the operator. This newly proposed process is then tested and validated through a second dismantling experimentation on a similar forklift truck. Moreover, a practical spreadsheet, to be used by the industrialist, is proposed and applied as a decision-making support tool to compare and select the most appropriate end-of-life pathways for recovered components according to the economic aspects of each circular option, among reuse, remanufacturing and material recovery. Eventually, lessons learnt from this industrial case study open up on broader implications and challenges (e.g., the applicability, generalization and scaling-up of commendable practices from one industrial sector to another) to achieve a more advanced circular economy in the heavy vehicle industry.",Circular economy | Dismantling process | Economic recovery | Heavy vehicles | Industrial case study | Remanufacturing,29,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

First, the value chain and related stakeholders are mapped out in an MFA-like model to both facilitate the assessment of stocks and flows, and get a comprehensive view of potential action levers and resources to close-the-loop. Then, through the cross analysis of numerous data sources, two MFA are completed: (i) one general MFA, and (ii) one sector-specific MFA, drawing a distinction between the fate of Pt from (a) light-duty vehicles, under the European Union's End of Life Vehicle Directive 2000/EC/53, and (b) heavy-duty and off-road vehicles. Key findings reveal a leakage of around 15 tons of Pt outside the European market in 2017. Although approximately one quarter of the losses are due to in-use dissipation, 65% are attributed to insufficient collection and unregulated exports. Comparing the environmental impact between primary and secondary production, it has been estimated that halving the leakage of Pt during usage and collection could prevent the energetic consumption of 1.3 × 103 TJ and the greenhouse gases emission of 2.5 × 102 kt CO2 eq. Through the lens of circularity indicators, activating appropriate action levers to enhance the CE performance of Pt in Europe is of utmost importance in order to secure future production of new generations of CC and fuel cells. Moreover, the growing stockpile of Pt from CC in use indicates the need for better collection mechanisms. Also, the CC attrition during use and associated Pt emissions in the environment appears non-negligible. Based on the scarce and dated publications in this regard, we encourage further research for a sound understanding of this phenomenon that can negatively impact human health.",catalytic converter | circular economy | circularity indicators | material flow analysis (MFA) | platinum | value chain,31,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

New tools are required to support practitioners, decision-makers and policy-makers towards more CE practices, as well as to monitor the effects of CE adoption. Worldwide, academics, industrialists and politicians all agree on the need to use CE-related measuring instruments to manage this transition at different systemic levels. In this context, a wide range of circularity indicators (C-indicators) has been developed in recent years. Yet, as there is not one single definition of the CE concept, it is of the utmost importance to know what the available indicators measure in order to use them properly. Indeed, through a systematic literature review – considering both academic and grey literature – 55 sets of C-indicators, developed by scholars, consulting companies and governmental agencies, have been identified, encompassing different purposes, scopes, and potential usages. Inspired by existing taxonomies of eco-design tools and sustainability indicators, and in line with the CE characteristics, a classification of indicators aiming to assess, improve, monitor and communicate on the CE performance is proposed and discussed. In the developed taxonomy including 10 categories, C-indicators are differentiated regarding criteria such as the levels of CE implementation (e.g. micro, meso, macro), the CE loops (maintain, reuse, remanufacture, recycle), the performance (intrinsic, impacts), the perspective of circularity (actual, potential) they are taking into account, or their degree of transversality (generic, sector-specific). In addition, the database inventorying the 55 sets of C-indicators is linked to an Excel-based query tool to facilitate the selection of appropriate indicators according to the specific user's needs and requirements. This study enriches the literature by giving a first need-driven taxonomy of C-indicators, which is experienced on several use cases. It provides a synthesis and clarification to the emerging and must-needed research theme of C-indicators, and sheds some light on remaining key challenges like their effective uptake by industry. Eventually, limitations, improvement areas, as well as implications of the proposed taxonomy are intently addressed to guide future research on C-indicators and CE implementation.",Circular economy | Circularity indicators | Selection tool | Taxonomy,502,0,repositoryam,Green,,CBT,Ellison Medical Foundation

The proposed framework is used to extend the Green Profit Model – an optimization model to maximize the total profit from the sales of new and remanufactured products, while achieving environmental impact savings – by adding a third dimension to this model, which is the circularity performance. As such, in addition to remanufacturing, it covers a wider spectrum of circular economy practices, leading to additional economic opportunities and environmental trade-offs between maintenance, reuse, remanufacturing and recycling at a product, parts and material levels. A first formulation of this extended optimization model is given and discussed through an illustrative example. By connecting the circularity performance of products with possible economic profit and environmental impact savings, it thus contributes in advancing the understanding and linkages in the area of circular design, life cycle analysis, industrial decision-support tool, and environmental regulations. Concretely, practical implications for both design engineering and green policy making are highlighted.",,13,0,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

The shift towards constructing energy-efficient buildings is impelling higher performance. In sustainable building, occupants become a major source of uncertainty in energy consumption. Yet, energy simulation tools often account for occupant behaviour through predefined fixed consumption profiles. Therefore, energy and buildings experts are in need for more precise methods for better forecasting the influence of occupants on the building performance. An activity-based framework for quantifying occupant-related energy consumption is proposed. The energy consumption is quantified per domestic activity as a function of households’ socio-demographic and economic attributes. The aggregation of such domestic activity energy consumption provides an accurate estimation of the household energy consumption per daily, monthly and annually periods. First, a literature review about residential energy consumption and the existing modelling approaches is presented. Second, a systematic breakdown structure of energy end-uses is proposed. The activity-based framework is then introduced. An application example is demonstrated together with simulation results.

Each year, 12 million light vehicles plus 1 million HDOR vehicles reach their end-of-life. In a context of circular economy, following questions are of growing concern. To what extent is the circular economy achieved and implemented in the automotive and HDOR sectors? What industrial practices and regulations are prevalent and commendable in the light of the circular economy? While the end-of-life management of light vehicles − subjected to the ELV Directive 2000/53/EC – is widely studied in literature, the end-of-life stage of HDOR vehicles has been neglected for a long time from a research perspective. To fill this gap, extensive literature survey and in-depth investigations on the industrial ground are conducted. Key factors – i.e. regulations, business models and markets evolution, new and emerging technologies integration – affecting the circular economy performance of automotive and HDOR sectors are analysed. Notably, not only lessons learned from best industrial practices but also remaining challenges for a more circular economy are highlighted. Both industries are compared through the four buildings blocks of the circular economy and the four possible feedback loops defined by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. As a result, this research contribution could lead to practical applications, for instance, in supporting industrial practitioners or policy makers to realize the opportunities and challenges of closing the loops of HDOR vehicles from different perspectives.",Automotive | CE implementation | CE strategies | Circular economy | End-of-life management | Heavy vehicles,66,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

To change this, we propose a structured methodology, Radical Innovation Design (RID), which supports designers who want to work on the unstated needs of potential end users in order to create superior value. In this article, the first part of RID is introduced with its two subprocesses: Problem Design and Knowledge Design. In this first period, RID guides innovators to systematically explore users' problems and evaluate which ones are most pressing in terms of innovation, taking into account existing solutions. The result is an ambition perimeter, composed of a set of value buckets, that is, important usage situations where major problems are experienced and the current solutions provide little or no relief. The methodology then moves on to Solution Design and Business Design (which are not detailed in this article) to address the value buckets identified. With its emphasis on problem exploration, RID differs from methods based on early prototyping. The RID methodology has been validated in various industrial sectors and is well-adapted for healthcare innovation. To exemplify the methodology, we present a case study in dental imagery performed by 10 students in 8 weeks. This example demonstrates how RID favours efficiency in Problem Design and allows designers to explore unaddressed and sometimes undeclared user needs.",front-end of innovation | innovation methodology | need-seeker innovation | problem definition | value bucket,4,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,
