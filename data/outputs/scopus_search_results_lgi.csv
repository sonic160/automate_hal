Electric vehicles can represent additional load for the power system, but can also bring new opportunities for contributing to the efficient and resilient operations of the power grid. This is mainly because of their ability to provide back power to the system when it is not used for transportation, essentially serving as a moving battery source for the power grid. This so-called Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), Vehicle-to-Building (V2B), or, generally, Vehicle-to-X (V2X) capability of EVs has been extensively studied in the literature. However, the upcoming development of autonomous driving systems and their integration within sharing mobility services can significantly add to the possibilities of interaction between the transportation system and the power grid. This paradigm is studied to a much lesser extent in the existing literature. Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicles (SAEVs) could allow for more control of the actions of the fleet allowing for large-scale coordinated responses both to mobility and energy demands. This coordinated response can be particularly useful for providing emergency power services in case of power loss while maintaining a high level of transportation service. Thus, improving the overall resilience of the system. In this work, we develop a dynamic optimization framework to evaluate the potential contribution of the SAEV fleet for improving critical buildings’ energy resilience via V2B services. The model considers passengers’ pick-up and transportation, relocation of vehicles, and battery charging and discharging. Power outage scenarios for critical buildings are considered and the potential of the SAEV fleet to fully or partially respond to the emergency power outage is studied. In addition, sensitivity analysis for key parameters such as the outage parameters is introduced. The results of the case study for the Ile-de-France region in France shows that the SAEV fleet has the potential to provide V2B service for critical building at an acceptable loss of passenger total waiting time on the transportation side. Furthermore, it is shown that it is capable of satisfying the emergency power load at a lower cost compared to investing in extra backup generators unless the outage occurs at significantly high frequencies.",Autonomous electric vehicles | Model predictive control | Resilience of complex systems | Rolling horizon optimization | Vehicle-to-building,0,0,,,,undefined,

Analyzing vulnerability characteristics of DHNs is of great significance in heating safety decision-making. In this study, we analyze the structure, function, operation, and failure characteristics of DHNs and propose vulnerability analysis methods. We develop failure simulation models under fully-controllable (FC) and uncontrollable (UC) conditions for six failure scenarios based on component importance. To verify the proposed methods' effectiveness, we applied them to a DHN in a Chinese city. Upon analyzing the appositeness of various vulnerability assessment indicators, we find that the heat source connectivity efficiency loss rate, established based on hydraulic distribution in DHNs, can effectively characterize both topological and functional vulnerability. Our analysis also reveals that controllable DHNs, which evenly distribute heat supply among connected users for fairness, can result in lower flow and greater functional vulnerability compared to UC DHNs. In particular, under large area failure (AF) scenarios, the average functional vulnerability of UC DHNs increases by 27.59% to 38.30% compared to small-AF scenarios, while that of controllable DHNs increases by 103.78% to 120.58%.

Transitions towards sustainable and people-centred urban mobility systems are paramount. Yet, this is accompanied by various challenges. Complex urban systems are accompanied by high uncertainties (e.g., technological progress, demographics, climate change) which are currently not well integrated. Possible solutions originate from design, policymaking, and innovation, with a widespread disconnection due to non-compatible methods. This paper presents a method to improve the ability to design future urban mobility systems by integrating different approaches for modelling what the future could be and who could be the users. The research question is how diverse future user needs can be integrated in design processes for urban mobility systems. The proposed scenario-based design and personas allows to create data-driven proto-personas—a set of archetypical users with assigned characteristics and behaviours—test their validity, derive distributions across geographical areas, and transform them for different 2030 scenarios. This serves as input to create full personas and synthetic populations as intermediary design objects for the collaboration of designers and simulation experts. The methodology is exemplarily applied in the context of Paris. It contributes to urban mobility solution design that is more aware of future uncertainty and diverse needs of users, therefore, better capable to respond to today’s challenges.

Nevertheless, not all relevant indicators can be calculated with this data alone. Our feasibility study objective is to analyze 1) the availability of data sources; 2) the availability of each indicator elementary variables, and 3) to apply natural language processing to automatically retrieve such information. Method: We performed a multicenter cross-sectional observational feasibility study on the clinical data warehouse of Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP). We studied the management of breast cancer patients treated at AP-HP between January 2019 and June 2021, and the quality indicators published by the European Society of Breast Cancer Specialist, using claims data from the Programme de Médicalisation du Système d'Information (PMSI) and pathology reports. For each indicator, we calculated the number (%) of patients for whom all necessary data sources were available, and the number (%) of patients for whom all elementary variables were available in the sources, and for whom the related HQSI was computable. To extract useful data from the free text reports, we developed and validated dedicated rule-based algorithms, whose performance metrics were assessed with recall, precision, and f1-score. Results: Out of 5785 female patients diagnosed with a breast cancer (60.9 years, IQR [50.0–71.9]), 5,147 (89.0%) had procedures related to breast cancer recorded in the PMSI, and 3732 (72.5%) had at least one surgery. Out of the 34 key indicators, 9 could be calculated with the PMSI alone, and 6 others became so using the data from pathology reports. Ten elementary variables were needed to calculate the 6 indicators combining the PMSI and pathology reports. The necessary sources were available for 58.8% to 94.6% of patients, depending on the indicators. The extraction algorithms developed had an average accuracy of 76.5% (min-max [32.7%–93.3%]), an average precision of 77.7% [10.0%–97.4%] and an average sensitivity of 71.6% [2.8% to 100.0%]. Once these algorithms applied, the variables needed to calculate the indicators were extracted for 2% to 88% of patients, depending on the indicators. Discussion: The availability of medical reports in the electronic health records, of the elementary variables within the reports, and the performance of the extraction algorithms limit the population for which the indicators can be calculated.

Various characteristics of the branched and looped structure are studied in their influence on system vulnerability, based on which several design criteria for single-source DHNs are deduced. Specifically, single-source branched DHNs shall be designed as symmetrical to avoid long pipelines bearing enormous heat loads. When transforming the branched DHNs into looped DHNs, priority should be given to adding cotrees between the intermediate nodes of high importance, and the diameters of looped pipes should be enlarged.

While its economics and performance as a sector coupling technique have been well studied in the context of perfectly competitive energy markets, the distortions caused by the presence of large strategic players with a multi-market presence have received little attention. In this paper, we examine them by specifying a partial equilibrium model that provides a stylized representation of the interactions among the natural gas, electricity, and hydrogen markets. We calibrate our model using the future Dutch energy system as a reference. Using this model, we compare several possible ownership organizations for PtG to investigate how imperfect competition affects its operations. Evidence gained from these market simulations show that the effects of PtG vary with the multi-market profile of its operator. Producers of fossil-based hydrogen tend to make little use of PtG, whereas renewable power producers use it more to increase the electricity prices. Although PtG operations are profitable and can be welfare-enhancing, welfare distribution among agents is highly unequal when PtG is strategically operated in conjunction with variable renewable generation. In that case, PtG also raises environmental concerns as it stimulates the use of polluting thermoelectric generation.",Hydrogen | Mixed complementarity problem | Multi-market oligopoly | Power-to-Gas | Renewable energy sources | Sector coupling,1,0,repositoryam,Green,UMD,undefined,University of Maryland

We compared the cancer stage for new breast cancers (BCs) before and during the pandemic. Methods: We performed a retrospective multicenter cohort study on the data warehouse of Greater Paris University Hospitals (AP-HP). We identified all female patients newly referred with a BC in 2019 and 2020. We assessed the timeline of their care trajectories, initial tumor stage, and treatment received: BC resection, exclusive systemic therapy, exclusive radiation therapy, or exclusive best supportive care (BSC). We calculated patients' 1-year overall survival (OS) and compared indicators in 2019 and 2020. Results: In 2019 and 2020, 2055 and 1988, new BC patients underwent cancer treatment, and during the two lockdowns, the BC diagnoses varied by −18% and by +23% compared to 2019. De novo metastatic tumors (15% and 15%, p = 0.95), pTNM and ypTNM distributions of 1332 cases with upfront resection and of 296 cases with neoadjuvant therapy did not differ (p = 0.37, p = 0.3). The median times from first multidisciplinary meeting and from diagnosis to treatment of 19 days (interquartile 11–39 days) and 35 days (interquartile 22–65 days) did not differ. Access to plastic surgery (15% and 17%, p = 0.08) and to treatment categories did not vary: tumor resection (73% and 72%), exclusive systemic therapy (13% and 14%), exclusive radiation therapy (9% and 9%), exclusive BSC (5% and 5%) (p = 0.8). Among resected patients, the neoadjuvant therapy rate was lower in 2019 (16%) versus 2020 (20%) (p = 0.02). One-year OS rates were 99.3% versus 98.9% (HR = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77–1.2), 72.6% versus 76.6% (HR = 1.28; 95% CI, 0.95–1.72), 96.6% versus 97.8% (HR = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.61–1.94), and 15.5% versus 15.1% (HR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.72–1.37), in the treatment groups. Conclusions: Despite a decrease in the number of new BCs, there was no tumor stage shift, and OS did not vary.",breast neoplasms | COVID-19 | early detection of cancer | health services research | quality of health care | routinely collected health data,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,ARC,COVID202001343,Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer

The main results of the critical literature review include: First, we summarize the dependent failure behavior in different system hierarchies, i.e., failure mechanism level, component level, system level and systems-of-systems level. In each level, the main dependent failure behavior from literature is discussed with examples. Second, we develop a classification framework for the dependent failure behavior models.

Resilience assessment of emergency systems can improve emergency response capability and system functional recovery. The increasing complexity and coupling of factors in emergency response systems need to be investigated from a system resilience perspective. In this paper, we propose to integrate a multi-stage System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) with a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) for the resilience assessment of emergency response systems. In the proposed methodology, emergency response systems are viewed as multi-step emergency operations for STAMP to analyze the hierarchical control and feedback structures. The output of multi-stage STAMP in controllers, actuators, sensors, and controlled processes is applied to develop a DBN for resilience assessment. For known external shocks (e.g., natural disasters), the effects of external shocks on the system are decomposed into subsystems or components. System degradation and recovery models are established. Regarding unknown external disruption (e.g., unforeseen failure modes), degeneration and recovery are temporally integrated into the analysis of system functionality. System performance is evaluated through the combination of socio-technical factors and external disasters. Eventually, the resilience of emergency response systems is obtained from the performance curves. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can evaluate system resilience after the system suffers from external disasters.",Dynamic Bayesian network | Emergency operations | Multi-stage STAMP | Resilience assessment,3,0,,,NSFC,KJGG-2022-17-05,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Problem-specific features of the E-ADARP include: (i) the employment of EAVs and a partial recharging policy; (ii) the weighted-sum objective function that minimizes the total travel time and the total excess user ride time. In this work, we propose a Deterministic Annealing (DA) algorithm and provide the first heuristic results for the static E-ADARP. Partial recharging (i) is handled by an exact route evaluation scheme of linear time complexity. To tackle (ii), we propose a new method that allows effective computations of minimum excess user ride time by introducing a fragment-based representation of paths. These two methods compose an exact and efficient optimization of excess user ride time for a generated E-ADARP route. To validate the performance of the DA algorithm, we compare our algorithm results to the best-reported Branch-and-Cut (B&C) algorithm results on existing instances. Our algorithm provides 25 new best solutions and 45 equal solutions on 84 existing instances. To test the algorithm performance on larger-sized instances, we establish new instances with up to 8 vehicles and 96 requests, and we provide 19 new solutions for these instances.

These novel applications, on the other hand, bring new challenges to network resilience. Among them, traffic variation is one of the most vital threats to the 5G network. With tens of thousands of devices connected to the network, network service resilience is threatened by the heavy traffic change induced by the end users or malicious attacks. While long timescale traffic variation can be easily predicted based on historical data, short timescale abnormal traffic is hard to forecast yet can significantly violate the service requirements. The impact of short timescale traffic variation can be mitigated by 5G management and control systems. However, the complexity and dynamics of the virtualized 5G system make it hard to estimate its resilience. This paper provides a 5G network model that captures the data traffic changes and network dynamic management mechanism. The model is able to evaluate the performance of different network services with different requirements under traffic variation events. We analyze the effectiveness of auto-scaling and compare different isolation strategies for traffic congestion.

In case of failures due to natural events, random disturbances, or deliberate attacks, the design of the coupling interface is a key factor for maintaining high performance within the interdependent CIs. However, in the existing literature, the issue of the coupling interface design is often addressed through heuristics. In this work, we propose an optimization-based mathematical approach for designing coupling interfaces between interdependent critical infrastructures under random failures. The proposed approach allows designing a coupling interface that is robust against the worst realization of a set of feasible failure scenarios.

It is a broader transdisciplinary field in our increasingly complex human-machine world that focuses on integrating technology, organizations, and people within a complex sociotechnical system throughout its life cycle. Therefore, HSI is no longer a question of usability and user interface design once a complex machine is technologically developed, but also about considering people and organizations early on in the design and development processes. Indeed, rooted in industrial engineering research and operational worlds, HSI requires a deeper foundation based on an epistemological approach. This assertion is even more crucial today as technology has become predominantly digital, and, more specifically, the concept of the digital twin is emphasized because it has become essential to support model-based HSI. In other words, software-based assistant systems are replacing traditional tools. Therefore, appropriate social-cognitive (multi-agent) models and methods are helpful throughout the life cycle of contemporary sociotechnical designs to account for the complexity and tangibility of their human-centered context-sensitive architectures, combining procedural and declarative knowledge. By considering these reasons, this article provides a set of fundamental axioms, some theoretical abstractions, and valuable practical models, which are presented and illustrated through the lens of an evolutionary HSI ontology.",Complexity | Epistemology | Human systems integration | Ontology | Procedural and declarative knowledge | Sociotechnical maturity,1,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,NASA,undefined,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

We analytically show that the underlying engineering equations de facto define Cobb-Douglas production functions for both fluids. We then use these production functions to determine the cost-minimizing decisions of a pipeline operator and infer the optimal ratio of oversizing. From a policymaking perspective, this ratio indicates whether the level of oversizing envisioned by the operator is consistent with its expectations of future demand (and thus, by contrast, whether it is attempting to overcapitalize and exploit a regulatory flaw). As the anticipations of the operator may fail to materialize, we opt for a minimax regret perspective and compare the performances of the operator's investment decisions under alternative demand trajectories. Our study shows that the conservative recommendation to build for the proven demand only is systematically regret-maximizing. Consequently, an infrastructure push would likely contribute to overcoming the chicken and egg problem and thus support the large-scale deployment of these emerging technologies.",Carbon capture and storage (CCS) | Hydrogen | Minimax regret | Oversizing | Pipeline operator,1,0,,,,undefined,Fondation Tuck

It ensures system operation and increases reliability, availability, maintainability, testability, safety, and reuse of system entities and technologies. For the reconfiguration of a system in use, it is necessary to assess, in continuity, the system's state with regard to its context. Identifying data supporting system reconfiguration represents a major industrial challenge and is linked directly to the development of industrial reconfiguration tools. Reconfiguration tools are based on a data model, also called ontology, which represents key concepts of system reconfiguration and their relationships. A particular difficulty of developing the data model is the multi-domain nature of reconfiguration. Furthermore, it needs to address a considerable diversity of system types. Few publications propose an ontology supporting data identification and tool development for the entire process. Hence, in this paper we propose to formalize the system reconfiguration process and propose an overarching ontology, which we call OSysRec. This ontology considers data at the management, dynamics, and structure level. The proposed ontology has been developed based upon expert knowledge and several industrial uses cases.

This goal can be achieved by dynamically adjusting the location of rescue teams during a day in response to some temporal or geographical fluctuations such as demand patterns, traffic conditions, or the number of teams on duty. This relocation is known as the multi-period redeployment problem. In this study, we propose a discrete simulation-based optimization model to adress the multi-period redeployment problem in the French EMS of the Val-de-Marne department (France), named SAMU 94. The proposed model uses an iterative method that combines the use of a mathematical model to find the optimal locations of rescue teams with the use of the SAMU 94 simulation model implemented in Arena software, to evaluate the busy fraction parameters required to solve the mathematical model. The model performance was compared with that of the simulation-based optimization software, OptQuest. The experimental results demonstrated that the iterative method could produce solutions with better coverage performance, 20 times faster than OptQuest.",ambulance relocation | Discrete simulation-based optimization | emergency medical services | multi-period redeployment | OR in healthcare,2,0,,,ANR,undefined,Agence Nationale de la Recherche

Among others, it will require optimised techno-economic solutions that offer sustainable decarbonisation pathways for the concurrent decarbonisation of many sectors of the economy. This paper attempts to provide empirical evidence of the ‘rooftop solar PV+EV concept’ efficacy as a promising pathway to decarbonise France's transport, power and building sectors concurrently. Using the System Advisor Model (SAM), we find that if rooftop solar PV is installed on half of the available roof space, and if half of the passenger vehicle owners replace their internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) with EVs by 2030, then France can meet 20 %–42 % of total electricity demand in the three most populous cities. Moreover, the solar PV + EV coupling can reduce CO2 emissions from passenger vehicle use and electricity generation by 43 %–48 %. Also, the coupling can be a potentially worthwhile investment with a payback period of 2–3 years, a levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of about €0.04/kWh, and a net present value (NPV) of €6–19 billion without a feed-in tariff. We analyse the potential implementation challenges of the ‘rooftop solar PV + EV concept’ and propose some solutions. Finally, we argue that coupling rooftop solar PV + EV in cities is a cost-effective strategy to decarbonise urban energy, transport and building sectors concurrently. Therefore, the government should consider enacting combined rooftop solar PV + EV decarbonisation policies that offer economic and environmental benefits.",Decarbonisation | Electric vehicle | Energy transition | Market design | Public policy | Rooftop solar PV,3,0,,,,undefined,Université Paris-Saclay

However, most studies focus on point RUL prognostics, with limited insights into the uncertainty associated with these estimates. This limits the applicability of such RUL prognostics to maintenance planning, which is per definition a stochastic problem. In this paper, we therefore develop probabilistic RUL prognostics using Convolutional Neural Networks. These prognostics are further integrated into maintenance planning, both for single and multiple components. We illustrate our approach for aircraft turbofan engines. The results show that the optimal replacement time for the engines is close to the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval of the RUL estimates. We also show that our proposed maintenance approach leads to a cost reduction of 53% compared to a traditional Time-based maintenance strategy. Moreover, compared with the ideal case when the true RUL is known in advance (perfect RUL prognostics), our approach leads to a limited number of failures. Overall, this paper proposes an end-to-end framework for data-driven predictive maintenance for multiple components, and showcases the potential benefits of data-driven predictive maintenance on cost and reliability.",Aircraft | C-MAPSS turbofan engines | Maintenance scheduling | Predictive maintenance planning | Probabilistic remaining useful life prognostics,9,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,EDF Energy

To propose a realistic study framework, four architectures of supermarket refrigeration systems are modelled and simulated using ground data with different climatic conditions and electricity mixes (France, Sweden, Spain). The overall results of these operational scenarios show that the electricity mix is the most influential parameter on cost and environmental impact. In addition, architecture using CO2 refrigerant shows interesting performances regardless of location and despite degraded regimes during heat peaks. However, the maintenance score can be a limiting factor for installing more energy efficient systems. Two other scenarios are studied: with photovoltaic panels; with financial support. Photovoltaic panels help improving cost and environmental performances, but also strongly depend on maintenance performances.

The degradation of the components in the multistate system is modeled via imprecise Markov models. Then, in the first-stage optimization, upper and lower bounds of the degradation model parameters are determined by minimizing the conflict between the prediction of the model and the multisource imprecise information elicited from experts. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is tailored to solve the computational problems brought by the presence of high-dimensional decision variables and resolve the optimization problem. The second-stage optimization is, then, conducted to identify the upper and lower bounds of the system reliability function given that the degradation model parameters are constrained in the bounds obtained from the first-stage optimization.

Despite this general statement, the literature still overlooks how enterprises should apply various DTs of Industry 4.0 across the entire product lifecycle to operationalize CE-related strategies. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a conceptual framework exploring DTs in terms of CE operationalization from the perspective of the product lifecycle. Based on insights gained through a systematic literature review, we clarify how DTs can facilitate CE performance objectives through the three stages of the product lifecycle: product design, product use, and product recovery or recycling. Furthermore, we study how various Industry 4.0 DTs, such as the Internet of things, big data, and cloud computing, are utilized to operationalize the transition toward a CE. DTs applied to the service-oriented product-service system contributes innovation into circular business models to make full use of idle resources and provide high-quality personalized services. We have adopted three performance objectives: using fewer materials and resources, extending product lifespan, and closing the loop to evaluate the effects of DTs in promoting CE development. By investigating how DTs affect CE performance objectives, the conceptual framework developed in this paper advances the knowledge regarding the role of DTs as an enabler of CE from the product lifecycle.

However, encouraging sustainable consumption patterns and CE-oriented consumer behavior to enable the CE in practice is complex and in its infancy stage. This study aims to clarify, frame, and measure consumer contributions to the implementation of the CE in regard to the 10R circular strategies: recover, recycle, repurpose, remanufacture, refurbish, repair, re-use, reduce, rethink, and refuse. The study employs a semi-systematic literature review and a conceptual analysis to develop an inclusive framework of consumer behaviors relating to CE perspectives in practice. The manuscript addresses three goals. First, a tri-dimensional consumer role in contributing to the CE transition is mapped, considering the consumer as (i) a product customer who acquires products or services, (ii) a product user who retains the value of products, and (iii) an end-of-life product holder who discards products. Framing this tri-dimensional contribution is essential to closing the loop on products through (i) careful use and maintenance, (ii) proper collection, and (iii) reuse, repair, or recycling. Second, based on the “closing–slowing and future–past” matrix developed, a CE-related product typology involving fifteen circular product categories is proposed. Third, a five-level hierarchical pyramid for CE-related products is presented to rank the fifteen circular product categories identified from more circular to less circular. Thus, five levels of consumer contributions to the CE, from low to high, are defined as corresponding to the circular product categories identified. As a result, a novel product-centric framework of CE-related consumer behavior to monitor and measure product-level consumer contributions to the CE is developed. The resulting conceptual framework opens up further perspectives for policymakers and producers to more effectively manage the process of directing consumer behavior toward more circular and sustainable consumption alternatives.",Circular economy | Circular strategy | Consumer behavior | Product circularity | Sustainable consumption,20,0,,,EC,620966-EPP-1-2020,European Commission

Typically, the production plan is followed by a material requirement planning to ensure the availability of the required component and order the needed quantities from suppliers. This is why routing these elements and their availability greatly impacts the production plan and vice versa. The coordination of both plans simultaneously can improve the quality of the planning decisions and reduce operational costs. This research studies the effect of integrating routing decisions with the production plan considering environmental impact. We developed a mixed integer linear programming model; the objective function of the problems includes the operational inbound routing costs, the holding cost of components in the manufacturing site's inventory, the lateness cost of the production order, and minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. Our study is exemplified in a numerical example where we present three different scenarios, highlighting how prioritizing the manufacturing site's different objectives can directly impact the production plan of the manufacturing orders.",Carbon Emission | Integrated Planning | Optimisation | Supply-Production Planning,0,0,,,,undefined,

Poor understanding of the range of influences on safety may have hindered improvement. Taking an interdisciplinary perspective, we sought to characterise the everyday practice of CTG monitoring and the work systems within which it takes place, with the goal of identifying potential sources of risk. Methods: Human factors/ergonomics (HF/E) experts and social scientists conducted 325 hours of observations and 23 interviews in three maternity units in the UK, focusing on how CTG tasks were undertaken, the influences on this work and the cultural and organisational features of work settings. HF/E analysis was based on the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety 2.0 model. Social science analysis was based on the constant comparative method. Results: CTG monitoring can be understood as a complex sociotechnical activity, with tasks, people, tools and technology, and organisational and external factors all combining to affect safety. Fetal heart rate patterns need to be recorded and interpreted correctly. Systems are also required for seeking the opinions of others, determining whether the situation warrants concern, escalating concerns and mobilising response. These processes may be inadequately designed or function suboptimally, and may be further complicated by staffing issues, equipment and ergonomics issues, and competing and frequently changing clinical guidelines. Practice may also be affected by variable standards and workflows, variations in clinical competence, teamwork and situation awareness, and the ability to communicate concerns freely. Conclusions: CTG monitoring is an inherently collective and sociotechnical practice. Improving it will require accounting for complex system interdependencies, rather than focusing solely on discrete factors such as individual technical proficiency in interpreting traces.",Healthcare quality improvement | Human factors | Obstetrics and gynecology | Qualitative research | Social sciences,0,1,,,,RHZF/001-RG88620,Health Foundation

However, its deployment critically depends on the installation of CO2 infrastructures. As the regulatory procedures governing their provision are yet to be clarified, this paper aims to assess the social and environmental impacts of such regulations. We show how the engineering equations of a CO2 pipeline implicitly define a Cobb-Douglas production function. We then infer that the resulting cost function exhibits economies of scale and verifies the technological condition for a natural monopoly. As the possible exertion of market power is a concern, we evaluate the social distortion of the unregulated monopoly and the average-cost pricing solution, which we compare to the outcomes of the welfare-maximizing solution. While the deadweight loss obtained under average-cost pricing remains lower than 5% compared to the first-best solution, our findings indicate that allocative efficiency is an issue, with more than a quarter of the CO2 emissions not being transported. This analysis will use-fully inform the emerging regulatory policy debates on CCS by providing the first analytically determined cost function of a CO2 pipeline.",Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) | CO  pipelines 2 | Cobb-Douglas | Regulation,0,0,,,,undefined,

It is used in several high-risk sectors, but only in a very limited way in healthcare. We examined the first documented attempt to apply the Safety Case methodology to clinical pathways. Methods: Data are drawn from a mixed-methods evaluation of the Safer Clinical Systems programme. The development of a Safety Case for a defined clinical pathway was a centrepiece of the programme. We base our analysis on 143 interviews covering all aspects of the programme and on analysis of 13 Safety Cases produced by clinical teams. Results: The principles behind a proactive, systematic approach to identifying and controlling risk that could be curated in a single document were broadly welcomed by participants, but was not straightforward to deliver. Compiling Safety Cases helped teams to identify safety hazards in clinical pathways, some of which had been previously occluded. However, the work of compiling Safety Cases was demanding of scarce skill and resource. Not all problems identified through proactive methods were tractable to the efforts of front-line staff. Some persistent hazards, originating from institutional and organisational vulnerabilities, appeared also to be out of the scope of control of even the board level of organisations. A particular dilemma for organisational senior leadership was whether to prioritise fixing the risks proactively identified in Safety Cases over other pressing issues, including those that had already resulted in harm. Conclusions: The Safety Case approach was recognised by those involved in the Safer Clinical Systems programme as having potential value.

We use a genetic algorithm to derive the optimal opportunistic maintenance plan by minimizing the long-run operational cost considering both maintenance cost and potential penalty costs due to failure in the future. The model recommends additional preventive operations in cases where the reliability does not satisfy the quality condition and to reduce the long-run operational cost.

To understand the potential for 3D printing at a hospital level, we report the results of an interview study in a French general hospital. We analyse the current use of 3D printing and estimate the potential for new applications. We explore what share of these applications could be internalised, and what would be the organisational implications and the key success factors for an internal 3D printing unit. We find a large untapped potential for internal production of 3D printed products, spanning a much broader range of applications and hospital departments than what currently exists in the hospital.

Regarding variability, Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) methods and Product Line Engineering (PLE) techniques become essential to configuring products by selecting and arranging features in a combination. In parallel, versioning and temporal evolution are managed with the configuration management (CM) principles. A versioned feature model (FM) is proposed. In PLE methodology, the first step is to model variability through traditional FM. This research presents an extension of the FM by integrating CM into it. The versioned FM includes not only features' variants but also their versions, making it evolve in time. This work is presented as a base for a work that will study the application of CM for PLE.

We think sociologists can help characterise the likely social impacts of future products. So we propose an original framework called the Representation-Usage-Impact (RUI) method to stimulate sociologists' projection and capture relevant knowledge about probable social impacts. The method includes a database structure encoding the knowledge of sociologists for further use in the design process. Its goal is to help designers avoid making choices today that may be regretted in decades. We illustrate the method and its process with the design of autonomous vehicle scenarios, as it will likely bring many new usages in the future.

CBM optimization problems are complex for multi-component systems, facing the issue of the curse of dimensionality brought by the increase in the number of components. Reinforcement learning provides a promising perspective to overcome the issue. In this paper, we studied CBM optimization for a multi-component system in which the components degrade subject to the gamma process independently. We considered multiple maintenance choices for individual components, leading to a large combinatorial action space. In this case, traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms like DQN may struggle to face the inefficiency of exploration. Instead, we propose exploiting Branching Dueling Q-network (BDQ), which incorporates the action branching architecture into DQN to drastically decrease the number of estimated actions. We trained a learning agent to minimize the expected cost for a long time horizon by taking maintenance actions according to the observed exact degrading signal for each component. We compared the policy learned by the agent with some other pre-defined static policies. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the learning algorithm and its potential for application in systems with more complex structures.",Branching Dueling Q-Network | Condition-based maintenance | Deep Reinforcement learning | Optimal maintenance planning,0,0,,,,undefined,

Knowing multiple good alternatives can help decision-makers easily switch solutions when needed, such as when faced with unforeseen constraints. A multimodal optimization task aims to find multiple global optima as well as high-quality local optima of an optimization problem. Evolutionary algorithms with niching techniques are commonly used for such problems, where a rough estimate of the optima number is required to determine the population size. In this paper, a partition-based random search method is proposed, in which the entire feasible domain is partitioned into smaller and smaller subregions iteratively. Promising regions are partitioned faster than unpromising regions, thus, promising areas will be exploited earlier than unpromising areas. All promising areas are exploited in parallel, which allows multiple good solutions to be found in a single run. The proposed method does not require prior knowledge about the optima number and it is not sensitive to the distance parameter. By cooperating with local search to refine the obtained solutions, the proposed method demonstrates good performance in many benchmark functions with multiple global optima. In addition, in problems with numerous local optima, high-quality local optima are captured earlier than low-quality local optima.",multimodal optimization | multiple optima | niching | partition-based random search,2,1,repositoryvor,Green,NSFC,52275499,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Traditional PF is a recursive Bayesian filtering framework that updates the posterior probability density function of RULs when new observation data become available. In engineering practice, due to the limited accuracy of monitoring/inspection techniques, the observation data available for PF are inevitably imprecise and often need to be treated as interval data. In this article, a novel Interval Particle Filtering (IPF) approach is proposed to effectively leverage such interval-valued observations for RUL prediction. The IPF is built on three pillars: (i) an interval contractor that mitigates the error explosion problem when the epistemic uncertainty in the interval-valued observation data is propagated; (ii) an interval intersection method for constructing the likelihood function based on the interval observation data; and (iii) an interval kernel smoothing algorithm for estimating the unknown parameters in the IPF. The developed methods are applied on the interval-valued capacity data of batteries and fatigue crack growth data of railroad tracks.

Most of the existing works on selective maintenance assumed that after each mission, the components’ states can be precisely known without additional efforts. In engineering scenarios, the states of the components in a system need to be revealed by inspections that are usually inaccurate. Inspection activities also consume the limited resources shared with maintenance activities. We, thus, put forth a novel decision framework for selective maintenance of partially observable systems with which maintenance and inspection activities will be scheduled in a holistic and interactively sequential manner. As the components’ states are partially observable and the remaining resources are fully observable, we formulate a finite-horizon Mixed Observability Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) model to support the optimization. In the MOMDP model, both maintenance and inspection actions can be interactively and sequentially planned based on the distributions of components’ states and the remaining resources. To improve the solution efficiency of the MOMDP model, we customize a Deep Value Network (DVN) algorithm in which the maximum mission success probability is approximated. A five-component system and a real-world multi-state coal transportation system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is shown that the probability of the system successfully completing the next mission can be significantly increased by taking inspections into account.

The proposed model is a novel epidemiological compartmental model formulated as a non-linear programming model that is suitable to address the inherent non-linearity of an infectious disease progression within the population. A number of novel features are implemented in the model to take into account important disease characteristics, such as asymptomatic infection and the distinct risk levels of infection within different segments of the population. Moreover, a method is proposed to estimate the vulnerability level of the different communities impacted by the pandemic and to explicitly consider equity in the resource allocation problem. The model is validated against real data for a case study of COVID-19 outbreak in France and our results provide various insights on the optimal testing intervention time and level, and the impact of the optimal allocation of testing resources on the spread of the disease among regions.

We address the short-term planning of empty-RTI flows (i.e., reverse flows) which consists of optimizing the transportation routes used to return empty RTIs from customers to suppliers. A transportation route consists of one or several trucks traveling from a customer to a supplier at a given frequency. The RTI short-term planning problem is critical because it impacts the continuity of loaded-RTI flows and affects the transportation and shortage costs of empty RTIs incurred at the very-short-term. We study a heterogeneous fleet of automotive parts RTIs, under two configurations: pool RTIs, which are standard RTIs shared between suppliers, and dedicated RTIs that are specific to each supplier. To solve the short-term planning problem, we develop a two-step approach using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and a greedy heuristic. For pool RTIs, our models enable a reduction of 30% in the number of trucks used and 20% in the distance traveled. Furthermore, if dedicated and pool RTIs are jointly planned, this would enable a 9% gain in terms of transportation costs.",automotive industry | greedy heuristic | MILP | optimization | returnable transportation item | reverse logistics | supply chain management,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

To achieve a rational result, experts from different areas should be involved, and the uncertainties in their assessments should be properly addressed. Such information is often referred to as multisource imprecise information (MSII) and might contain high degree of conflicts, as different experts usually have different expertise and knowledge. Properly quantifying the conflicts among the MSII, then, becomes a critical issue, as the subsequent processing of MSII (e.g., combination and calibration), depends on the degree of conflict in the MSII. To this end, a new conflict measure is put forth based on the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) to quantify and visualize the conflict in the MSII from a group of experts. In the first place, the MSII from each expert is used to construct the basic belief assignment (BBA) of the reliability estimates for the corresponding expert under the DST. A 2-D conflict measure, which combines the conflict factor and Jousselme distance in DST, is, then, proposed to measure the conflict between the experts' BBAs. The conflict is quantified from two perspectives, viz., mutual conflict and total conflict. Finally, a Bhattacharyya distance-based method is developed to further quantify the informativeness of each expert's MSII to the system reliability estimate.

We propose an original economic framework to explore this question and apply it to a real case study in Sweden. Assuming carbon removal credits will be integrated into the prevailing carbon market, we show that, although a carbon removal accounting framework based on a lifecycle methodology discourages investment in inefficient BECCS processes, it may induce BECCS lock-out from CO2 infrastructures.

In this context, aviation emissions represent a critical challenge to aviation activities, especially with the increasing travel demand up to the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, starting in 2020. One of the potential drivers that would help the aviation industry reduce its emissions is the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In this study, we analyzed the impact of SAF from an air traffic flow management (ATFM) perspective, considering delay and re-routing costs. We developed an optimization model that considers, in addition to the traditional ATFM costs, fuel costs and carbon dioxide emissions. We investigated the impact of accounting for these two new aspects, that is, fuel costs and emissions, on ATFM performance, and we compared SAF with conventional fuel. The analysis of a real case study revealed that, in addition to delay and re-routing costs, fuel cost should be included in the ATFM model so that the resulting solution becomes economically and environmentally realistic for airlines. The increase in the fuel cost and network delays when using SAF requires setting an appropriate carbon price under an emission policy, such as the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international flights policy, to make SAF more attractive. Furthermore, flexible re-routing programs for flights operated using SAF make it advantageous from an ATFM perspective.",Air traffic flow management (ATFM) | Carbon price | Emission policy | Green aviation | Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),3,1,repositoryam,Green,UOS,2018-02998,University of Sharjah

When developing data-driven fault diagnosis models for EMA, training and testing data might come from different working conditions, reducing the generalization ability of traditional data-driven models. To address the challenge of domain difference between training and testing data, we propose a hybrid domain adaptation network, whose loss functions comprise of adversarial loss, triplet loss and cross-entropy loss. Adversarial loss and triplet loss can enhance the inter-domain and intra-class domain clustering, respectively. A softmax classifier with cross-entropy loss is used to predict pseudo labels for unlabeled target domain training samples. Compared to traditional transfer learning models that only reduces the global inter-domain difference between two domains, the strength of our model is that both the intra and inter-class domain difference are reduced. Curriculum pseudo labeling (CPL) is further applied to dynamically adjust thresholds for different classes during training phases. Compared to the fixed threshold in previous efforts, CPL can take into account the difference in pseudo label prediction and improve the performance of the developed model.

This article suggests a PDC approach that enables SPs to learn how to make control decisions to react to disturbances and maintain continuity of operations. The control mechanism involves an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) augmented with Expert rules to cope with the limitations of standard AHP in dealing with dynamic problems. The mechanism is applied to a dispatching problem in an industrial scale assembly process. A multi-agent discrete event simulation model is used to create a set of normal and disturbed production scenarios. SP agents use context indicators and performance assessment to activate Expert rules and update AHP preferences and scales before making dispatching control decisions to react to disturbances.

Circularity is mostly associated with material efficiency strategies that either close, slow or narrow loops, and a multitude of circularity metrics have been developed to evaluate the efficiency of such strategies. Relatively little effort has been made to quantitatively assess the connection between circularity, material efficiency, and environmental sustainability. More knowledge is required about how material-based circularity metrics can be used to guide practitioners of the circular economy towards strategies that foster environmental sustainability. In this study, a novel structured approach is adopted to perform such a comparison by including closing, slowing, and narrowing strategies on a lawn mowing case. Four circularity metrics that can capture material strategies throughout product value chains (Material Efficiency Metric, Material Circularity Indicator, Circularity Potential Indicator and Circular Economy Indicator Prototype) are compared to three complementary midpoint categories using Life Cycle Assessment (Global Warming Potential, Material Resource Scarcity, and Human Non-Carcinogenic Toxicity). The results show that the studied circularity metrics generate accurate results when evaluating Material Resource Scarcity and that they rank the material efficiency strategies equally with all environmental impact categories. The circularity metrics are unable to capture the benefits of reduced energy and the correspondence to all impact categories is lower in scenarios with higher energy use. We conclude that the strength of the studied circularity metrics is twofold: i) promoting solutions that reduce material demand and waste creation and ii) highlighting the advantages of combining complementary circularity strategies. This research shows that the material-based circularity metrics can be valuable guidance tools for practitioners of circular economy, as they do not require methodological expertise and can align the results with Life Cycle Assessments in some specific situations. More comparisons between circularity metric results and Life Cycle Assessments are needed in future research to establish state-of-the-art circularity metrics for specific situations and purposes, including energy-focused circularity metrics.",Case study | Circular economy | Circular economy loops | Circularity metrics | Industrial value chain | Life cycle assessment,10,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,HiG,20201594,Högskolan i Gävle

Methods: We retrospectively retrieved the electronic health records and administrative data of 11.4 million patients pertaining to Greater Paris University Hospital (AP-HP). We compared indicators for the 2018–2019 period to those of 2020 in regard to newly referred lung cancer cases. We assessed the initial tumour stage, the delay between the first multidisciplinary tumour board (MTB) and anticancer treatment initiation, and 6-month overall survival (OS) rates depending on the anticancer treatment, including surgery, palliative systemic treatment, and best supportive care (BSC). Result: Among 6240 patients with lung cancer, 2179 (35%) underwent tumour resection, 2069 (33%) systemic anticancer therapy, 775 (12%) BSC, whereas 1217 (20%) did not receive any treatment. During the first lockdown, the rate of new diagnoses decreased by 32% compared with that recorded in 2018–2019. Initial tumour stage, repartition of patients among treatment categories, and MTB-related delays remained unchanged. The 6-month OS rates of patients diagnosed in 2018–2019 who underwent tumour resection were 98% versus 97% (HR = 1.2; 95% CI: 0.7–2.0) for those diagnosed in 2020; the respective rates for patients who underwent systemic anticancer therapy were 78% versus 79% (HR = 1.0; 95% CI: 0.8–1.2); these rates were 20% versus 13% (HR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1–1.6) for those who received BSC.

In order to test and analyze how the algorithms behave and perform, we apply the concept of a digital twin. The implemented anticipatory algorithms compared here are a sample scenario planning approach and two waiting strategies. The question of the value of more sophisticated algorithms compared to algorithms with less computational effort is investigated. The experimental results show that solution quality benefits from incorporating information about future requests, and that simple waiting strategies prove most suitable for such a highly dynamic environment.

Finding an optimal protection plan often takes the form of a multilevel optimization problem. Recently, approaches based on distributionally robust optimization (DRO) have gained the attention of many scholars. In fact, DRO allows protecting the decision-maker from the ambiguity arising from the imprecisely identified probability distributions of the failure scenarios. In this framework, the probability distribution of the failure scenarios is assumed to be known ambiguously, and contained in an ambiguity set defined by moment-based conditions. In practice, some decisions taken in the protection plan affect the conditions of the ambiguity set. We refer to this situation as DRO with endogenous uncertainty. In this paper, we study the impact of the endogenous uncertainty on the optimal protection plan of a power network, using a numerical example built upon the IEEE 14-bus system with a traditional moment-based ambiguity set.",critical infrastructures | distributionally robust optmization | moment-based ambiguity set | optimal protection | Power network,0,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

Grid control is even more critical during extreme events as the WAC function is required to orchestrate the response to contingencies and enhance the power system resilience through failure localization, isolation, and service restoration. Both power and telecommunication domains are involved in control applications, giving rise to multiple cyber-physical interdependencies. This paper proposes a resilience-based optimization of the distribution service restoration (DSR) by coordinating strategies of crew dispatch and manual/remote switches operation. The telecommunication service and underlying infrastructure are identified as main enablers of the co-optimization as all considered resilience strategies communicate with the control center that collects crisis management information. Therefore, the availability of telecom points in terms of power supply is examined in this work. Failure propagation in the coupled power-telecom network is highlighted, and differences in failure propagation between overhead and underground power lines are explored. The proposed approach is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, evaluated under a multi-feeder interdependent power-telecom test network. Results show that combined scheduling of resilience strategies as well as prioritization of power supply to telecom points-of-interest, yield an enhanced recovery strategy.",Distribution Service Restoration | Extreme Event | MILP | Resilience | Wide Area Control,0,1,repositoryam,Green,EDF,undefined,Orange

For this reason, recently few studies have started to investigate the vulnerability of a highly coupled traffic-power system in the presence of disruptive events. Actually, however, only very few of these studies have considered the impact of EVs on the interdependent traffic-power system during restoration from a disruptive event. In an attempt to fill this gap, in this study, we investigate the restoration planning of both independent RNs and PNs, and interdependent traffic-power systems. A mixed integer program model is formulated to provide optimal reconfiguration and operational solutions for post-disruption traffic-power systems recovery. The objective of the model is to minimize the total cost incurred by system performance loss, which is quantified by the cumulative unmet traffic demand for RNs and load shedding cost for PNs. Several reconfiguration strategies are considered, including links reversing in RNs and line switching in PNs, to optimize system resilience. In the proposed model, the integrated problem of system optimal dynamic traffic assignment and optimal power flow is solved to derive the optimal traffic-power flow. RNs and PNs are coupled through the coordinately allocated spatio-temporal charging demand of EVs. A partial highway network in North Carolina (NC), USA, and a modified IEEE-14 bus system are used to illustrate the application of the model.

Arrival times relative to scheduled appointments are random. Customers are not homogeneous in their punctuality and show-up behavior. The time between consecutive appointments is allowed to vary from customer to customer. Moreover, service times are assumed to be random with a γ-Cox distribution, a class of phase-type distributions known to be dense in the field of positive distributions. We develop both exact and approximate approaches for characterizing the distribution of the number of customers seen by each arrival. We show how this can be used to obtain the distribution of waiting time for each customer. We prove that the approximation provides an upper bound for the expected customer waiting time when non-punctuality is uniformly distributed.

Users may choose and rank their preferred modes of transport for different times of the day. In this way, we account for, e.g., different traffic conditions throughout the planning horizon. We study different variants of the problem. In the base problem, the sequence of tasks a user has to fulfil is fixed in advance and travel times as well as preferences are constant over the planning horizon. In variant 2, time-dependent travel times and preferences are introduced. In variant 3, we examine the challenges when allowing additional routing decisions. Variant 4 integrates variants 2 and 3. For this last variant, we develop a branch-and-cut algorithm which is embedded in two bi-objective frameworks, namely the ϵ-constraint method and a weighting binary search method.

Building on the initial taxonomy of c-indicators, this project extends the identification of sets of c-indicators to more than 100. Working with a think tank of CE experts from major French industrial companies, five new features have been added to better characterize a set of c-indicators to its practical use in an industrial context. These new features are: (i) CE spheres considered, (ii) life cycle stages covered, (iii) the availability of use cases, (iv) the popularity, and (v) transparency. Statistical trends and critical analysis on these c-indicators are then given. On this basis, a set of ten complementary c-indicators is particularly proposed, covering a wider spectrum of the CE paradigm, including, e.g., material flow, energy flow, impact, design, and corporate-based indicators. In practice, to support decision-makers in the industry (e.g., managers, engineers, product leaders, designers) compute and deploy appropriately these c-indicators, a new and highly visual factsheet for c-indicators is developed.

We develop a method to simulate nuclear schedule optimization to reflect how plant managers maximize plant availability during peak-demand periods. Using this schedule optimization, we compute each plant's minimum power level and its variation over time to evaluate the flexibility potential. Three nuclear flexibility hypotheses are considered: one where fleet schedule is considered constant, which is standard practice in the energy systems modeling literature, one with an optimized fleet schedule with constant minimum power, and one with an optimized fleet schedule with physics-induced minimum power variations. Sensitivity analysis highlights the links between the fleet's schedule optimization, minimal power variations, relative share of nuclear and renewables in the capacity mix, and results of simulation models. We find that the nuclear fleet's optimization and associated realistic minimum power variations gain in importance with increasing relative share of nuclear in the capacity mix. The schedule's importance holds as renewables' installed capacities heighten as the residual demand level decreases. This paper highlights the potential benefits of modeling nuclear schedule optimizations and the resulting minimum power evolutions. Both aspects are crucial for evaluating nuclear flexibility characteristics in simplified low-carbon electric systems that use a significant share of renewable energy.",Economic dispatch | Flexible power operation | Mixed-integer linear programming | Nuclear energy | Nuclear schedule | Renewable energy integration | Unit commitment,5,0,,,CEA,undefined,Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives

The supply chain comprises a set of suppliers delivering their products loaded on RTIs to a set of customers. RTIs are of various types. The objective is to model a deterministic, multi-supplier, multi-customer inventory routing problem with pickup and delivery of multi-RTI. The model includes inventory-level constraints, the availability of empty RTIs to suppliers, and the minimisation of the total cost, including inventory holding, screening, maintenance, transportation, sharing, and purchasing costs for new RTIs. Furthermore, suppliers with common customers coordinate to virtually pool their inventory of empty RTIs held by customers so that, when loaded RTIs are delivered to customers, each may benefit from this visit to pick up the empty RTI, regardless of the ownership. To handle the combinatorial complexity of the model, a new artificial-immune-system-based algorithm coupled with deep reinforcement learning is proposed. The algorithm combines artificial immune systems’ strong global search ability and a strong self-adaptability ability into a goal-driven performance enhanced by deep reinforcement learning, all tailored to the suggested mathematical model. Computational experiments on randomly generated instances highlight the performance of the proposed approach. From a managerial point of view, the results stress that this new approach allows for economies of scale and cost reduction at the level of all involved parties to about 40%. In addition, a sensitivity analysis on the unit cost of transportation and the procurement of new RTIs is conducted, highlighting the benefits and limits of the proposed model compared to dedicated and physical pooling modes.",artificial immune systems | closed loop supply chain | deep reinforcement learning | inventory routing problem | pickup and delivery | returnable transport items,5,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Robots can visit areas with van access restrictions, such as pedestrianized areas or university campuses. The van stops at parking nodes to drop off and/or pick up its robot, and to replenish its robot and/or swap its robot's battery if needed. Five van/robot pickup and delivery cases are considered, according to the roles the van/robot plays in the process of pickup/delivery and whether the van transports its robot. To model the proposed problem, we introduce a mixed-integer program including time, freight, and energy. We further propose an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm to solve larger instances and a capacity feasibility test approach for a single route. We then assess the influence of parking node density on model output. A case study based on a realistic city scenario is introduced. A sensitivity analysis is performed on the robot's travel cost and maximum travel distances, and the effect of van no-go areas is studied.

Air traffic flow management (ATFM) is the process of managing flights in this situation. In this paper, we present an ATFM model that accounts for different rerouting options (path rerouting and diversion) and preexisting en route flights. The model proposes having a central authority to control all decisions, which is then compared with current practice. We also consider interflight and interairline fairness measures in the network. We use an exact approach to solve small- to medium-sized instances, and we propose a modified fix-and-relax heuristic to solve large-sized instances. Allowing a central authority to control all decisions increases network efficiency compared with the case where the ATFM authority and airlines control decisions independently. Our experiments show that including different rerouting options in ATFM can help reduce delays by up to 8% and cancellations by up to 23%. Moreover, ground delay cost has much more impact on network decisions than air delay cost, and network decisions are insensitive to changes in diversion cost. Furthermore, the analysis of the tradeoff between total network cost and overtaking cost shows that adding costs for overtaking can significantly improve fairness at only a small increase in total system cost. A balanced total cost per flight among airlines can be achieved at a small increase in the network cost (0.2%–3.0%) when imposing airline fairness. In conclusion, the comprehensiveness of the model makes it useful for analyzing a wide range of alternatives for efficient ATFM.",air traffic flow management | airborne delay | flight cancellation | flight diversion | flight overtaking | ground holding | mathematical modeling | path rerouting,4,0,repositoryam,Green,UOS,2018-02998,University of Sharjah

This may bring new stresses and risks to such a system of systems. This paper presents a mathematical framework to analyze the resilience of an electrified road network (ERN) subject to potential failures of its supporting fast-charging stations (FCSs). Within this framework, a novel linear optimization model is proposed for the first time to solve the system optimal dynamic traffic assignment problem of ERN. The characteristics considered in the modeling framework include the location, capacity, and charging speed of FCSs, as well as the driving range, charging time, and state of charge (SoC) of EVs. The linear model is proposed based on the cell transmission model. It is used as the first-stage model to assign the traffic under normal FCS operations. A second-stage model is, then, extended to minimize the total travel time after the stochastic occurrence of FCS failures, that is, in the failure and recovery phases. Two metrics are considered to quantify the ERN performance and the impacts of FCS failures. A numerical example is studied to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework for analyzing ERN resilience. The results show that deploying FCSs near the highway entrances and maintaining their operation are relevant factors to enhance the system's resilience.

These systems are usually modeled as multiperformance multistate systems (MPMSSs). However, existing MPMSS models fail to consider an important aspect, i.e., the performance conversion process. For example, in a combined heat and power (CHP) generating unit, apart from the output heat and electricity, decision-makers are also interested in the unit's capacity to convert gas into electricity and heat. The latter is related to the performance conversion process. This article proposes a framework for the reliability evaluation of performance conversion-based MPMSS. In the proposed MPMSS model, the couplings among different types of performances inside the components are quantified into the multistate performance conversion matrix. The performance conversion structure functions are proposed to derive system performance conversion capability based on the conversion capabilities of the components.

Aim To quantify the time GPs spend on different activities during clinical sessions; to identify the number of operational failures they encounter; and to characterise the nature of operational failures and their impact for GPs. Design and setting Mixed-method triangulation study with 61 GPs in 28 NHS general practices in England from December 2018 to December 2019. Method Time–motion methods, ethnographic observations, and interviews were used. Results Time–motion data on 7679 GP tasks during 238 hours of practice in 61 clinical sessions suggested that operational failures were responsible for around 5.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.5% to 5.4%) of all tasks undertaken by GPs and accounted for 3.9% (95% CI = 3.2% to 4.5%) of clinical time. However, qualitative data showed that time–motion methods, which depend on pre-programmed categories, substantially underestimated operational failures. Qualitative data also enabled further characterisation of operational failures, extending beyond those measured directly in the time–motion data (for example, interruptions, deficits in equipment/supplies, and technology) to include problems linked to GPs’ coordination role and weaknesses in work systems and processes. The impacts of operational failures were highly consequential for GPs’ experiences of work. Conclusion GPs experience frequent operational failures, disrupting patient care, impairing experiences of work, and imposing burden in an already pressurised system. This better understanding of the nature and impact of operational failures allows for identification of targets for improvement and indicates the need for coordinated action to support GPs.",Ethnography | General practice | Mixed methods | Operational failures | Operations research | Time and motion studies,6,1,repositoryam,Green,NIHR,NF-SI-0617-10026,National Institute for Health Research

In real-life cases, engineers need to design an optimal MSSPS structure by combining different versions and number of redundant components. The objective of the design is to ensure reliability requirements using the least costs, which could be formulated as a redundancy optimization problem under reliability constraints. The genetic algorithm is one of the most frequently used method for solving redundancy optimization problems. In traditional genetic algorithms, the population size needs to be determined based on the experience of the modeler. Often, this ends up creating a large number of unnecessary samples. As a result, the computational burden can be huge, especially for large-scale MSSPS structures. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an optimal structure designing method named as redundancy ordinal optimization. The universal generating function technique is applied to evaluate the reliabilities of the MSSPSs. Based on the reliabilities, an ordinal optimization algorithm is adapted to update the parent populations and the stopping criterion of genetic algorithm, so that the unnecessary structure designs can be eliminated. Numerical examples show that the proposed method improves the computational efficiency while remaining satisfactorily accurate.",genetic algorithm | multi-state series-parallel systems | ordinal optimization | Redundancy optimization | reliability assessment,0,0,repositoryam,Green,NSFC,71871200,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The uncertainty of electricity demand and renewable power generation is taken into account through bounded intervals, with parameters that permit control over the level of conservatism of the solution. The multistage robust optimization model allows the sequential representation of uncertainty realization as they are revealed over time. It also guarantees the non-anticipativity of future uncertainty realizations at the time of decision-making, which is the case in practical real-world applications, as opposed to two-stage robust and stochastic models. To render the resulting multistage robust problem tractable, decision rules are employed to cast the uncertainty-based model into an equivalent mixed integer linear (MILP) problem. The re-formulated MILP problem, while tractable, is computationally prohibitive even for moderately sized systems. We, thus, propose a solution method relying on the reduction of the information basis of the decision rules employed in the model, and validate its adequacy to efficiently solve the problem. The importance of considering multistage robust frameworks for accounting for net-load uncertainties in generation expansion planning is illustrated, particularly under a high share of renewable energy penetration. A number of renewable penetration scenarios and uncertainty levels are considered for a case study covering future generation expansion planning in Europe. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in coping with multifold operational uncertainties and for deriving adequate generation investment decisions. Moreover, the quality of the solutions obtained and the computational performance of the proposed solution method is shown to be suitable for practical policy-making generation expansion planning problems, seeking to evaluate the impact of uncertainty on future system-wide performance.",Generation expansion planning | High renewable energy systems | Multistage adaptive robust optimization | Uncertainty treatment | Unit commitment,21,1,repositoryam,Green,NUS,R-266-000-070-281,National University of Singapore

A vessel not knowing its position while navigating in the Arctic may find itself in a critical situation. In the framework of the 2nd CASSINI Hackathon aimed to promote ideas based on safe passage in the Arctic, the authors developed a product called North Star. The aim of North Star is using Earth Observation data provided by Galileo and Copernicus services to improve navigation in the Arctic. It consists of an on-board neural engine, the AI Pilot, which searches for and identifies a safe route for the user. The neural engine can be trained on the Copernicus data from the Sentinel constellation, which includes information such as ice thickness, iceberg distribution, wind speed direction, and wave height for a specific passage. In the event of a satellite signal loss, the AI Pilot reuses the information received from Galileo up to that point and integrates them with the vessel's own maritime sensors to maintain the viability of the projected route. The idea behind the AI Pilot is that when a vessel is within communication range with other North Star vessels, they form an ad-hoc mesh network of data collectors with edge computing capabilities. The creation of a mesh network can provide augmented data to the entire GNSS ecosystem. While shipping transportation of oil and gas across the Arctic passages undergoes more strict regulations, private tourism and charter yacht operators in the Arctic are an emerging market due to the relatively unsafe travel conditions. North Star can have a beneficial impact on the tourist sector in the first place, extending afterwards to support Search and Rescue operations, as well as contributing to the protection of the environment and the Arctic fauna. This research presents the concept of operations of North Star, as well as its high-level description from the technical perspective. The potential of this business case is further investigated, to include a roadmap of services offered until the return of investment, potential customers, and current competitors.",Arctic Ocean | Artificial Intelligence | Copernicus Services | Maritime Navigation | Sensor Fusion | Tourism,0,0,,,EC,undefined,European Commission

The large-scale deployment of BECCS is hindered by economic, social, and environmental barriers that have been subject to an increasing number of studies. As most research on BECCS tends to adopt a central planning perspective, the barriers related to strategic interactions and coordination issues within the BECCS value chain are often overlooked. Based on a systematic literature review, we identify coordination-related challenges for BECCS deployment. We describe three challenges to BECCS deployment that should be further examined through the lens of coordination: (i) trading biomass and ensuring its sustainability; (ii) reducing costs through synergies with other industries and shared CO2 infrastructures; and (iii) coordinating policies internationally to provide revenues for BECCS.",Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage | Coordination problems | Negative emissions,3,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,Total

By contrast, many barriers can slacken the deployment of digital tools which need to be identified and tackled. The present work seeks to understand the nature of the opportunities and challenges that arise within the introduction of digitalization to promote the circular economy on a territorial level. Hence, through a systematic literature review, key issues associated with the deployment of digital tools are highlighted by emphasizing the areas of application; agriculture, transportation and energy. Subsequently, a 'Strengths, Challenges, Opportunities, Responses, Effectiveness' (SCORE) approach is adopted to investigate through a qualitative analysis the past, present and future opportunities and challenges. These findings are positioned and discussed with a key actor managing the Paris-Saclay territory and transitioning towards more circular economy practices.

As well known in the literature (Boylan and Syntetos (2021)), we find that negative binomial distribution fits better demand sizes and intervals. Secondly, we explain how to use a single echelon model that is easy to implement on the field, to control inventory and compute the stock target in the observable part of the closed-loop supply chain. It is modeled as a multi-echelon serial inventory system. Finally, we perform numerical analysis and comparisons of methods to compute the stock target of the observable part of the closed-loop supply chain with real data. Those methods are derivated from the up-to-level periodic inventory review policy where we vary the statistical distribution of the demand and the measure of the service level. Using the Item Fill Rate (IFR) as a service level measure in the stock target calculation, reduce the stock target by more than 10% compared to the stock target obtained using the Cycle Service Level (CSL).

Co-optimizing or co-planning transmission and generation expansion planning helps reflect the tradeoff between generation, load and transmission assets. Because of practical siting constraints of assets, the theoretical efficiency of locational signals does not concretely materialize. Limited coordination between generation and transmission reduces the co-planning efficiency. Moreover, long-term uncertainties, such as the amount of renewable capacity connected to the grid, significantly increase the risks taken when planning grid expansion.

OBJECTIVE: The study explores the main factors contributing to performance, trust and collaboration between expert human operators and increasingly autonomous machines, by developing and using the PRODEC method. PRODEC supports HSI by improving the agile HCD of advanced sociotechnical systems at work, which qualify as human-machine teamwork. METHODS: PRODEC incorporates scenario-based design and human-in-the-loop simulation at design and development time of a sociotechnical system. It is associated with the concept of digital twin. A systemic representation was developed and used, associated with metrics for the evaluation of human-machine teams. RESULTS: The study is essentially methodological. In practice, PRODEC has been used and validated in the MOHICAN project that dealt with the integration of pilots and virtual assistants onboard advanced fighter aircraft. It enabled the development of appropriate metrics and criteria of performance, trust, collaboration, and tangibility (i.e., issues of complexity, maturity, flexibility, stability, and sustainability), which were associated with the identification of emergent functions that help redesign and recalibrate the air combat virtual assistant as well as fighter pilot training. CONCLUSION: PRODEC addresses the crucial issue of how AI systems could and should influence requirements and design of sociotechnical systems that support human work, particularly in contexts of high uncertainty.

The time during which electric vans are carrying robots can be used to recharge the robots, thereby increasing the efficiency of the distribution system. To model the proposed system, we present a mixed integer program. We note that the energy transfer from a van to its robot needs time and will cause the available travel distance of a van to decrease and that of a robot to increase.

A sensitivity analysis for vehicle charging modes, charging rates, and maximum battery capacities shows that using en-route charging, while appropriately increasing battery level and charging rate can have useful effects on cost.",Adaptive large neighborhood search | Electric vehicle routing | Innovative last-mile distribution | Logistics | Van-based robot deliveries,6,0,repositoryam,Green,H2020,2019ZDLGY14-10,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

There are many proposed tools and methods to facilitate the application of this circular strategy, however, among them, there is a lack of support tools for practitioners that include multiple perspectives related to the value chain and circular economy. In fact, remanufacturing strategy, economic and environmental trade-offs, and circularity indicators are rarely integrated within one framework. In this paper, an approach is presented taking advantage of the state-of-the-art research on green profit model and circularity indicators; in other words, these tools are used together to unlock the circular potential in manufacturing practice. In this way, typical problems of production planning and control in remanufacturing processes are interconnected with the goals of sustainable development, also considering product design and end-of-life strategy choices. The presented framework represents a promising support to be used in industrial practice. A case study based on PV panel infrastructure allows a better comprehension of the research outputs and assesses the validity of the support provided by the framework in the deployment of circular economy strategies.",circular economy | circularity indicators | design for remanufacturing | end-of-life management | optimization | PV racking system | remanufacturing,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Considering these technological, sociological, and environmental stakes of BEV deployment, this paper aims to highlight the interests of multi-perspective analysis for electromobility. It introduces a methodology to analyse and compare performances of both conventional vehicles and BEVs, considering diverse possible usages. Fleet simulations on the highway linking Paris to Lyon (France) were conducted to provide recommendations for designers and insights for electromobility stakeholders such as drivers, carmakers, or infrastructure planners. Performance criteria such as average travel time, the number of charging points to install, and environmental impacts have been used to compare vehicles and evaluate the influence of users' behaviours and electricity mix. This study quantifies the travel time differences between conventional vehicles, average BEVs, and high-end BEVs and the effect of the driving speed choice and battery management on the performance criteria. Finally, electricity consumption is identified as a significant source of the BEV highway traffic environmental impacts, although they depend on the regional electricity mix; the battery life cycle is also an important source of impacts.",battery electric vehicles | environmental impacts | long-distance mobility | Multi-perspective analysis | simulation | user behaviour,0,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The safety function of a PSV is to open and relieve the pressure when the equipment pressure exceeds the predefined set point. To achieve the desired availability of the PSV function, periodic function testing is regularly performed to confirm the correct functioning of a PSV. If a fault of the PSV function is detected by a function test, the PSV is repaired to a functioning state. For this reason, the interval between function tests has a direct influence on the probability of failure on demand (PFD) of the PSV function. On the other hand, unwanted leakage can occur due to human errors made during the preparation prior to a test and the reinstatement after the test. Such leakage is not desired due to the potential for being ignited and causing a major accident, but this aspect is often not considered in the availability assessment of PSVs. Therefore, this paper suggests a multi-phase Markov approach that can estimate the PFD of a PSV as well as the frequency of the leaks induced by the periodic tests. The suggested approach may be suitable for supporting the decision about the test interval for a PSV, considering both reliability and risk effect of extending the function test interval.",,1,0,,,,undefined,

We first briefly review the issues raised by the deployment of charging infrastructure, namely technical, economic and user acceptance concerns. We then look at the goals of the infrastructure location models in the literature. Schematically, those goals fall into two categories: minimizing the cost of charging infrastructure for a given level of service, or maximizing the service provided for a given cost. Finally, we focus on the approaches used to achieve these goals. Three categories of approaches are identified: node, path, and tour- or activity-based approaches. We then discuss these approaches in relation to technical, economic and user acceptance factors in order to provide a comprehensive analysis for stakeholders involved in EV charging infrastructure planning.

A mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to solve the inventory routing problem with transshipment and substitution under stochastic demands. The objective is to minimise costs of holding inventory, transportation which includes regular shipment and transshipment, substitution and lost sales. To solve the problem, Sample Average Approximation method is used. Based on empirical goodness-of-fit tests, three demand patterns are studied: Poisson distribution, stuttering Poisson distribution and negative binomial distribution. The model is tested on well-known benchmark instances generated for multi-product multi-vehicle IRP. Computational experiments highlight the benefits of promoting transshipment and substitution on the overall supply chain performance. Results also suggest insights, which are of interest to professionals who are willing to develop new decision support models for the most efficient management of such items.",Routing | Sample average approximation | Spare parts management | Substitution | Transshipment,11,0,,,,undefined,

They promised more reliable equipment and a safer environment. An all-electric production system performs several functions related to hydrocarbon production control. It also performs safety functions by isolating the reservoir from the environment. Safety functions are performed by activation of safety valves. These safety valves include electric springs in their design instead of mechanical springs. Failure modes and effects analysis of these valves show that interruptions in the power supply appear as random demands to the safety valves, and experiencing such demands may deteriorate their performance. However, the current reliability assessment of safety valves does not consider any degradation phenomena. This paper's main objective is to investigate the degradation modes caused by demands and their influence on the all-electric actuation system's performance under different maintenance strategies. A degradation modeling framework based on the multiphase Markov process is proposed. The impact of demand is modeled by changing the initial condition or by increasing the transition rates between two degraded states. The amplitude of the increment depends on the condition at the time of the demand.

One of the general approaches to support the model-based roadmapping is to develop a roadmap's metamodel that would define it independently from the application context and link it to the existing roadmapping literature. In this paper, we attempt to create such a metamodel by generalizing and formalizing existing document-based roadmaps. We validate our metamodel via reproducing three very different roadmaps from the literature, not included in the set of roadmaps from which the metamodel was created, using the novel formal approach. The fact that these roadmaps were reproduced using the proposed metamodel indicates its applicability to many classes of real roadmaps.

Proper assessment of the costs and benefits involved in EV integration hinges on correctly modeling and evaluating EV-user driving and charging patterns. Recent studies have evidenced that EV users do not plug in their vehicle every day (here called non-systematic plug-in behavior), which can alter the impacts of EV charging and the flexibility that EV fleets can provide to the system. This work set out to evaluate the effect of considering non-systematic plug-in behavior in EV grid integration studies. To do so, an open-access agent-based EV simulation model that includes a probabilistic plug-in decision module was developed and calibrated to match the charging behavior observed in the Electric Nation project, a large-scale smart charging trial. Analysis shows that users tend to plug-in their EV between 2 and 3 times per week, with a lower plug-in frequency for large-battery EVs and large heterogeneity in user charging preferences. Results computed using our model show that non-systematic plug-in behavior effects reduce the impact of EV charging, especially for price-responsive charging, as fewer EVs charge simultaneously. On the other hand, non-systematic plug-in can reduce available flexibility, particularly when considering current trends towards larger battery sizes. Counter-intuitively, large-battery fleets can have reduced flexibility compared to small-battery fleets, both in power and stored energy, due to lower plug-in frequency and higher energy requirements per charging session. Improving plug-in ratios of EV users appears as key enabler for flexibility. In comparison, augmenting charging power can increase the flexibility provided by EV fleets but at the expense of larger impacts on distribution grids.",Charging choices | Electric vehicles | Electricity distribution systems | Smart charging | Vehicle-to-grid,31,1,repositoryam,Green,ANRT,2018/0031,Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie

In turn, the way utilities have been recovering their expenditures through tariffs needs reformulation. We investigate the impact of different retail tariff designs from a Californian scenario on private investment incentives and cost-shifting using solar PVs, stationary batteries, and electric vehicles. The private commercial facilities studied do not own the vehicles, and the vehicle owners are remunerated for energy services provided; this remuneration strongly depends on the connection hours of the vehicles and the type of tariff applied. EV net income varies annually from $57 to $218 per vehicle, reaching the highest values when stationary batteries are present and significant demand charges are applied. We found that an energy-based tariff incentivizes the adoption of solar PVs, bringing high private gains, but often with high cost-shifting. A shift toward coincident peak tariffs in the short term and capacity-based tariffs in the long run, if the cost of DERs continues to fall quickly, can alleviate cost-shifting caused by strong DER penetration.

For maximizing the call center's revenue, the call center manager exercises two levels of control: agent reservation for inbound calls and call outsourcing. Given the influence of waits on purchase probability, we investigate the strategy of outsourcing customers who have waited already as opposed to outsourcing customers directly at arrival. Academic/practical relevance: The main novelty of this article arises from the use of a single framework to investigate both the combination of agent reservation with outsourcing decisions, and a waiting time-based outsourcing strategy. The existing literature only considers these two strategies in isolation and is restricted to quantity-based decisions. From a practical viewpoint, our results aim to provide decision support tools that are directly implementable in a call center's routing software. Methodology: We apply a Markov decision process approach to optimize the manager's decisions. The particularity of our approach is that we use the experienced waiting time as a decision variable. Results: We prove that the optimal policy for reservation and outsourcing is of threshold type. Our main conclusion is that outsourcing customers after letting them wait in-house generates higher revenue than outsourcing calls at arrival. However, it is also detrimental to service quality. In addition, we identify contexts in which the difference between the two outsourcing strategies is significant. Managerial implications: Contrary to standard call center practices, which either consist of specialized teams for one type of call or only exercise one specific level of decision-making (reservation or outsourcing), we demonstrate the potential of partial outsourcing with partial reservation.

However, there is still a need for reducing unnecessary inspections and/or preventive maintenance actions and their associated cost, through optimal design of condition-based maintenance (CBM) strategies. Accordingly, mathematical modelling and optimization of CBM has become of interest for industry managers and researchers. This work explores on the application of a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) to encompass different modelling assumptions as non-negligible maintenance delays and inspection-based condition monitoring. These assumptions are relevant for many critical infrastructures in civil engineering or in oil & gas industry whose deterioration states are classified at a very high level of abstraction among a finite and small set of possible states. A formalism to model this type of problems is proposed in which the deterministic motion of the PDMP is reduced to a trivial differential equation to track the time elapsed between events. A numerical scheme for quantification, as an approximation of the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation, is presented. Later, an illustration case dealing with CBM of road bridges by the NPRA (Norwegian Public Roads Administration) is presented, guiding through the modelling and quantification approach.",Condition-based maintenance | Monte Carlo simulation | Numerical analysis | Piecewise deterministic Markov process | Road bridges maintenance | Stochastic modelling,17,0,,,NTNU,undefined,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet

Objectives: Systematic review of the effects of training healthcare professionals in intrapartum cardiotocography (PROSPERO protocol: CRD42017064525). Search strategy: CENTRAL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, British Nursing Database, CINAHL, ERIC, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, grey literature and ongoing clinical trials were searched. Selection criteria: Primary studies that reported impact of training healthcare professionals in intrapartum cardiotocography. Title/abstract, full-text screening and quality assessment were conducted in duplicate. Data collection and analysis: Data were synthesised both narratively and using meta-analysis. Risk of bias and overall quality were assessed with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and GRADE. Main results: Sixty-four studies were included. Overall, training and reporting were heterogeneous, the outcomes evaluated varied widely and study quality was low. Five randomised controlled trials reported that training improved knowledge of maternity professionals compared with no training, but evidence was of low quality. Evidence for the impact of cardiotocography training on neonatal and maternal outcomes was limited, showed inconsistent effects, and was of low overall quality. Evidence for the optimal content and method of delivery of training was very limited.

This work reviewed the scientific literature and key European demonstrator projects on the proactive integration of EVs into distribution grids. The main technical, economic, regulatory, and user-related aspects were analyzed and the associated barriers identified. There is a broad scientific literature on the technical feasibility of EV flexibility provision and coordination schemes, which has as well been proved in demonstrator projects, even though the required technologies for V2G (bidirectional chargers, communication protocols) are not yet widespread. On the other hand, main barriers are economic and institutional, largely due to a lack of regulatory frameworks to value flexibility at distribution level and thus uncertainty on the value of these flexibility services. In particular, this work analyzed four possible value frameworks (grid codes, connection agreements, tariffs and market platforms) to use flexibility at the distribution level, and their implementations with EV fleets in demonstrator projects.",Electric vehicles | Electricity distribution systems | Flexibility markets | Smart Charging | Smart grids | Vehicle-to-grid,77,1,repositoryam,Green,ANRT,2018/0031,Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie

This study aimed at assessing the number of new cancers during and after the lockdown. Methods: We prospectively collected the clinical data of the 11.4 million patients referred to the Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris Teaching Hospital. We identified new cancer cases between 1st January 2018 and 31st September 2020 and compared indicators for 2018 and 2019 to 2020 with a focus on the French lockdown (17th March to 11th May 2020) across cancer types and patient age classes. Results: Between January and September, 28,348, 27,272 and 23,734 new cancer cases were identified in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The monthly median number of new cases reached 3168 (interquartile range, IQR, 3027; 3282), 3054 (IQR 2945; 3127) and 2723 (IQR 2085; 2,863) in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. From March 1st to May 31st, new cancer decreased by 30% in 2020 compared to the 2018–19 average; then by 9% from 1st June to 31st September. This evolution was consistent across all tumour types: −30% and −9% for colon, −27% and −6% for lung, −29% and −14% for breast, −33% and −12% for prostate cancers, respectively. For patients aged <70 years, the decrease of colorectal and breast new cancers in April between 2018 and 2019 average and 2020 reached 41% and 39%, respectively.

In this paper, a systems thinking-based approach combined with a frequency analysis first permitted to build up a model of the sustainable values created by the project in a host country.

Tactical and operational decisions are considered in the proposed multi-product and multi-period planning problem. Using a rolling horizon, the approach aims at defining optimal quantities to produce, to store and to deliver. The integration consists in coordinating informational flows between producer and retailer. Information sharing will allow the producer to estimate more accurately the future replenishment orders that may happen at the operational level and adjust production capacity requirements accordingly. For this purpose, a two-stage planning approach is devised; the first stage deals with the tactical level while the second stage deals with the operational level. The monthly decisions taken at the tactical planning level are accounted for in the operational planning considering a variable rolling horizon. Moreover, accurate forecasts of future replenishment orders are established based on information sharing and introduced in the operational planning to determine the weekly decisions. Linear programming models are used to build production and distribution plans at the tactical and operational levels. Using real-life data from a textile and apparel Tunisian firm, we show that producer-retailer coordination based on the sharing of current sales information, yields significant cost savings reaching up to 20% of the supply chain cost.

In practice, the behaviors of the systems affected by these extreme events are often modeled by multistate models to facilitate the analysis. In this paper, we develop a generic framework for resilience modeling and analysis of multistate energy systems. A multistate resilience model is developed based on a Markov reward process model, where the degradation and recovery of system performance are characterized by a continuous time discrete state Markov chain and the losses caused by the extreme event is modeled by the reward rates associated with the sojourns in the degradation states and the transitions among the states. Four numerical metrics are defined to describe different aspects of system resilience, i.e. the resistant, absorption, recovery and overall resilience. A simulation-based algorithm is proposed for resilience analysis of multistate energy systems. The developed methods are applied for resilience modeling and analysis of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) under the threat of earthquakes. The Markov reward process model is developed following a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, a fragility analysis and an event tree modeling of accident evolutions. Both a time-static and time-dependent resilience analysis are conducted and the results show that the developed model is able to comprehensively describe the resilience of multistate energy systems under the threats of extreme events.",Accumulated reward | Energy system | Extreme events | Markov reward model | Multistate system | Resilience,39,0,repositoryam,Green,NSFC,71601010,National Natural Science Foundation of China

One application of crowdsourcing is the screening of citations for inclusion in a systematic review. There is evidence that a 'Crowd' of non-specialists can reliably identify quantitative studies, such as randomized controlled trials, through the assessment of study titles and abstracts. In this feasibility study, we investigated crowd performance of an online, topic-based citation-screening task, assessing titles and abstracts for inclusion in a single mixed-studies systematic review. METHODS: This study was embedded within a mixed studies systematic review of maternity care, exploring the effects of training healthcare professionals in intrapartum cardiotocography. Citation-screening was undertaken via Cochrane Crowd, an online citizen science platform enabling volunteers to contribute to a range of tasks identifying evidence in health and healthcare. Contributors were recruited from users registered with Cochrane Crowd. Following completion of task-specific online training, the crowd and the review team independently screened 9546 titles and abstracts. The screening task was subsequently repeated with a new crowd following minor changes to the crowd agreement algorithm based on findings from the first screening task. We assessed the crowd decisions against the review team categorizations (the 'gold standard'), measuring sensitivity, specificity, time and task engagement. RESULTS: Seventy-eight crowd contributors completed the first screening task. Sensitivity (the crowd's ability to correctly identify studies included within the review) was 84% (N = 42/50), and specificity (the crowd's ability to correctly identify excluded studies) was 99% (N = 9373/9493). Task completion was 33 h for the crowd and 410 h for the review team; mean time to classify each record was 6.06 s for each crowd participant and 3.96 s for review team members. Replicating this task with 85 new contributors and an altered agreement algorithm found 94% sensitivity (N = 48/50) and 98% specificity (N = 9348/9493). Contributors reported positive experiences of the task. CONCLUSION: It might be feasible to recruit and train a crowd to accurately perform topic-based citation-screening for mixed studies systematic reviews, though resource expended on the necessary customised training required should be factored in. In the face of long review production times, crowd screening may enable a more time-efficient conduct of reviews, with minimal reduction of citation-screening accuracy, but further research is needed.",Citations | Citizen science | Crowdsourcing | Evidence synthesis | Information retrieval | Systematic review,8,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

To cope with increasing disruptive events such as man-made and natural disasters attacking infrastructures, resilience should be considered as an integrated perspective into the system planning process. This paper presents a p-robust optimization model for infrastructure network planning against spatially localized disruptions. The optimization aims at minimizing the investment costs for system hardening and expansion and the total system costs under nominal operating conditions, while incorporating resilience requirements by the p-robustness constraints. Importantly, instead of only mitigating system vulnerability, the proposed model integrates the arranging of the repair sequence of damaged components under limited repair resources into the preevent system planning. The complexity of the proposed model is analyzed, and a hybrid algorithm that combines scenario-based decomposition and variable neighborhood search is developed for its efficient solution. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through an application to a real power transmission system. Quantitative analysis can assist managers in decision making regarding investing in different system protection actions and making a tradeoff between desired resilience and budget constraints.",Critical infrastructures (CIs) | disruption risk | optimization | system planning | system resilience,20,0,repositoryvor,Green,NSFC,71301123,National Natural Science Foundation of China

In developing countries where public transport is mostly inefficient and insufficient, MaaS could help to “balance the scale” with private transport offerings, such as ridesharing. Casual carpooling could be an affordable alternative. Not only for being a low‐tech transport mode but also for optimizing vehicle usage of idle seats. In that optics, we have identified drivers who would fa-cilitate integrating casual practices into a MaaS. To identify the motivating factors behind casual carpooling and propose a strategy to implement it in a MaaS scheme, a quantitative survey was applied to 307 university students in the city Lavras, Brazil. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques. We assumed that casual carpooling is sustained by solidarity, simplicity, and agility; no costs to passengers; and institutionalized pickup points. Then, we identify principal strategic components to implement such an initiative.

The e-waste collection issue has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in developing countries, due to low collection rates. This study aims to search for progressive solutions in the e-waste collection sphere with close-to-zero transport and infrastructure costs and the minimization of consumers’ efforts towards an enhanced e-waste management efficiency and collection rate. Along these lines, the present paper develops a smart reverse system of e-waste from end-of-life electronics holders to local recycling infrastructures based on intelligent information technology (IT) tools involving local delivery services to collect e-waste and connecting with interactive online maps of users’ requests. This system considers the vehicles of local delivery services as potential mobile collection points that collect and deliver e-waste to a local recycling enterprise with a minimum deviation from the planned routes. Besides e-waste transport and infrastructure costs minimization, the proposed smart e-waste reverse system supports the reduction of CO2 through the optimal deployment of e-waste collection vehicles. The present study also advances a solid rationale for involving local e-waste operators as key stakeholders of the smart e-waste reverse system.

This suggested that monitoring of these searches with tools including Google Trends may help monitor the pandemic itself. In Europe and North America, dermatologists reported an unexpected outbreak of cutaneous acral lesions (eg, chilblain-like lesions) in April 2020. However, external factors such as public communications may also hinder the use of Google Trends as an infodemiology tool. Objective: The study aimed to assess the impact of media announcements and lockdown enforcement on internet searches related to cutaneous acral lesions during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. Methods: Two searches on Google Trends, including daily relative search volumes for (1) “toe” or “chilblains” and (2) “coronavirus,” were performed from January 1 to May 16, 2020, with the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany as the countries of choice. The ratio of interest over time in “chilblains” and “coronavirus” was plotted. To assess the impact of lockdown enforcement and media coverage on these internet searches, we performed an interrupted time-series analysis for each country. Results: The ratio of interest over time in “chilblains” to “coronavirus” showed a constant upward trend. In France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, lockdown enforcement was associated with a significant slope change for “chilblain” searches with a variation coefficient of 1.06 (SE 0.42) (P=0.01), 1.04 (SE 0.28) (P<.01), and 1.21 (SE 0.44) (P=0.01), respectively. After media announcements, these ratios significantly increased in France, Spain, Italy, and the United States with variation coefficients of 18.95 (SE 5.77) (P=.001), 31.31 (SE 6.31) (P<.001), 14.57 (SE 6.33) (P=.02), and 11.24 (SE 4.93) (P=.02), respectively, followed by a significant downward trend in France (-1.82 [SE 0.45]), Spain (-1.10 [SE 0.38]), and Italy (-0.93 [SE 0.33]) (P<.001, P=0.004, and P<.001, respectively). The adjusted R2 values were 0.311, 0.351, 0.325, and 0.305 for France, Spain, Italy, and the United States, respectively, suggesting an average correlation between time and the search volume; however, this correlation was weak for Germany and the United Kingdom. Conclusions: To date, the association between chilblain-like lesions and COVID-19 remains controversial; however, our results indicate that Google queries of “chilblain” were highly influenced by media coverage and government policies, indicating that caution should be exercised when using Google Trends as a monitoring tool for emerging diseases.",Chilblains | COVID-19 | Dermatology | Google Trends | Infodemiology | Lesion | Media | Media coverage | Online health information | Skin lesions | Trend,10,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

However, its influence on non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) care pathway has never been studied. Objectives: To compare conventional care pathway to teledermatology (TD) in NMSC care pathways using a process modelling approach. Patients and methods: A period study including three groups was conducted in a department of dermatology. During the first period from January till February 2013 a NMSC care pathway was mapped for a group a prior TD integration. During the second period from September 2016 till October 2018, the NMSC care pathway was determined for patients managed by a conventional care process and after TD diagnosis. Patients characteristics, type of tumors and processes were compared using time as a key performance indicator. Mean were reported with their ± SD. Linear regression was performed using time between multidisciplinary consultation and surgery as outcome adjusted on sex, age and cancer type. Results: During the first period (prior to TD) 89 NMSC patients were managed (mean age = 76 yr old ± 13) during the second period, 36 patients NMSC were managed after TD, mean age of 89 years old ± 6 and 954 patients in a conventional process, mean age of 78 years old ±12. In comparison between the two periods patient's age, sex and cancer distribution significantly differed while the rate of surgery was not significantly different (p = 0.967). Linear multivariate regression using time between multidisciplinary consultation and surgery as outcome adjusted on sex age and cancer type displayed that during the second period patients in the TD group spent 17.6 days more [0.98,34.25] while patient in the conventional care process group had 9.8 days [1.85,17.74] more than patient in the study period 1, (p = 0.04, p = 0.02) without significant difference for age and sex (p = 0.29, p = 0.51). Patients with a SCC had a decreased time between multidisciplinary consultation and surgery of −12.97 days [−17.43, −8.5], p < 10−3. Conclusion: Interestingly, patients managed by TD were significantly older than those managed using a conventional care pathway. Unexpectedly their total time spent in the process was not shorter.

Vehicle development is based on simulation; thus, the design process is referred to as simulation-aided design. Engineering design is highly collaborative and knowledge intensive. Therefore, knowledge management plays a crucial role in today's global economy and is essential for the competitiveness of companies. However, current research on engineering knowledge management focuses on either the codification or the personalisation approaches of knowledge management. Thus, this paper addresses an integrated and collaborative approach. This paper aims to develop an ontology-based knowledge management approach to support simulation-aided design, specifically car crash simulation. The knowledge management support system is designed to ensure the capture and retrieval of engineering knowledge and to enable collaboration between different stakeholders. An evaluation of the models and technologies used is also undertaken, based on use case scenarios.",Collaboration | Crash simulation | Engineering design | Knowledge management | Knowledge model | Knowledge retrieval | Ontology,8,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

This paper offers a micro-simulation of the adoption of compressed natural gas in heavy-duty vehicles based on real French data on industrial flows in 2018 from the automotive manufacturer Renault. Our purpose is to assess the potential of natural gas as a transition fuel for the supply chain by determining the economic conditions under which natural gas is both economically and environmentally beneficial. We consider two types of natural gas: bio-sourced and fossil. Both types of gas trucks prove cost-effective for long-distance flows within a short 5-year time period. However, fossil-fuel natural gas trucks emit from 3 up to 13% more CO2eq than diesel trucks on the same trip, due to the extra kilometres required to reach refuelling stations (+6.21% of distance covered on average). Conversely, compared to diesel trucks, bio-sourced gas reduces the carbon footprint of transportation up to −76%. Thus, only bio-sourced gas proves to be favourable. We also investigate other types of externalities, such as air pollution and noise. We finally find that carbon taxes should be based on life-cycle emissions in order to boost wider adoption of biogas.",Carbon tax | Compressed natural gas | Energy transition | Externalities | Heavy-duty vehicles | Transport policy,13,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In real-life cases, considering that multiple different MSWKNS structures are provided beforehand, system designers need to select an optimal one among numbers of different structure designs. Thus, screening of the optimal MSWKNS structure is meaningful and critical. Moreover, the system reliability becomes an increasingly important factor that should be assessed in structure screening. However, when facing a large-scale MSWKNS whose number of states is enormous, exact reliability evaluation can be rather complicated. Meanwhile, due to the large number of system structure designs, the computational burden of screening can be very huge. To effectively select the optimal structure among enormous MSWKNSs under reliability constraint, an optimal structure screening method named as ordinal structure screening (OSS) is proposed. Ordinal optimization (OO) algorithm is adopted with a novel utilization of continuization discretization approximation (CDA) method. To shorten the reliability evaluation time, CDA is employed to approximate reliabilities. Based on the approximate reliabilities, OO is applied to reduce the number of system structures to be evaluated, which accelerates the screening process. Illustrative results show that the proposed method appeals in improving computational efficiency with satisfactory accuracy performance.",continuization | Discretization approximation | Multi-state weighted k-out-of-n system | Ordinal Optimization | Structure screening,5,0,repositoryam,Green,NSFC,51537010,National Natural Science Foundation of China

In the developed model, system performance changes, caused by either disruptive events or system recoveries, are modeled as state transitions, and rewards are used to model financial losses incurred during and after the disruptions. Four resilience metrics are defined to quantify different aspects of resilience. As the developed model is non-homogeneous, it can capture time-dependent system behaviors and their impact on system resilience. An efficient resilience analysis algorithm is also designed based on linear interpolation and implemented using vectorization. The computational benefits of the developed algorithm are demonstrated through two numerical experiments.

However, the large integration of distributed energy resources, such as electric vehicles (EV), heat pumps (HP), and photovoltaic (PV) systems, has a strong influence on the stability of low voltage (LV) distribution grids and can lead to high reinforcement costs. This work develops a methodology to quantify the impacts of a joint integration of EVs, PV, and HPs into LV distribution grids and the ability of a decentralized EV smart charging strategy to reduce the constraints. A central occupancy model generates demand and generation profiles for the studied technologies, which are then used to carry out Monte Carlo simulations for unbalanced power flow analysis of LV grids. A case study of a typical Belgian rural grid shows that the main impacts arise from HP integration, creating voltage deviations and transformer overloading. EV integration impacts are less significant, creating grid issues only at high-penetration levels and to a lesser extent than HPs. The proposed smart charging strategy allows reducing the impacts of EV integration; however, it does not allow increased penetration of the other technologies.

Such assessment methods suffered from a lot of limitations. For example, it is in general difficult to collect enough life testing data to support an accurate reliability assessment. Further, the experimental conditions can hardly reproduce the way a consumer will use a product in practice. In the meantime, with the expansion of the Internet, a lot of customers give their feedbacks on the products by posting reviews on websites. This constitutes a huge, easily accessible, and more realistic database that can be used to assess reliability. In this work, we scraped reviews from a famous e-commerce website. Machine learning models are developed to extract failure-related information from these reviews. Two kinds of information are examined in this study: (1) whether a review reports a failure and, in such a case, (2) the severity of the failure. We used natural language processing tools to process text and we developed different classification models for information extraction. The developed methods were tested on customer review data from 11 different tablets of several brands. The results we obtained were around 85% accuracy when training and testing our models with our dataset. Hence, the machine learning-based approach we developed is demonstrated to be a promising first step to assess reliability thanks to web-based data. However, with a corpus containing only a few thousand reviews and more than 100,000 words, using text to train classification models remains a complicated task.

The majority of European railway networks are electrified, and power transmission networks represent usually the main power supplier. Railway and power networks share thus a unidirectional interdependency, as the railway network functionality depends on the power network. Due to this interdependency, failures in power networks have the potential of causing vast disruption in the dependent railway networks. Despite this, the issue of modeling interdependent railway and power networks has not been addressed sufficiently carefully in the existing literature. Furthermore, the treatment of cascading failures in power networks and their consequences in railway networks is limited and approximative. In this work, we propose a modeling framework which accounts for more realistic assumptions on the interconnections topology and the cascading failures dynamics. Firstly, we model the interconnections between the railway and external power network by introducing the traction power network, which acts as a bridge between the external power grid and the railway network. Secondly, we model cascading failures in the external and traction power networks with an approach based on the DC power flow model. Thirdly, we suggest a simple approach to estimate the negative consequences on the railway network due to load shedding in the traction power network. Vulnerability analysis is performed to estimate the negative consequences in the railway network due to different failure scenarios in the external power network. Sensitivity analysis on the initial assumptions is also performed.",Cascading failures | Critical infrastructures | Interdependent networks | Power network | Railway network | Vulnerability,1,0,,,EDF,undefined,Electricité de France

Modern CIs rely on the fifth generation of mobile communication (5G) paradigm to incorporate new technologies, deliver new sophisticated services and adopt new business models. These models will shift the CI interdependencies towards a new dynamic paradigm where communication resources are deployed within the CIs operational scheme to reach performance and quality of service (QoS) objectives. Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Network Slicing (NS) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) are examples of 5G-enabling technologies used to reach the aforementioned objectives. However, due to the complex nature of CIs and the interdependencies between their components, the shift toward a dynamic operational scheme will increase the vulnerability and exposure to risks, impacting the network resilience. This requires the design of new resilience frameworks that consider the heterogeneity, privacy and self-interest nature of CIs and guarantee reliability and QoS objectives in such a constrained and dynamic environment. To tackle the resilience problem, we propose a framework to dynamically coordinate and manage the deployment of communications resources, based on NFV. This framework will ensure the availability of services, meet performance objectives during disruptive events and overcome constraints of interdependencies and heterogeneity.

We present here the first strategy, including two similar modeling methods that can be conducted for such strategy: a QFD approach or a morphological approach. Both are followed by a multicriteria analysis. In the first stage, a set of scenarios is generated, then consistency between different decision alternatives is investigated using compatibility matrix. In the second stage, an evaluation and selection of an appropriate scenario is performed. Finally, to illustrate this strategy, an example is presented.

With the recent advance of artificial intelligence techniques in the field of natural language processing, this research aims to develop an integrated machine learning solution to obtain sustainable design insights from online product reviews automatically. In this paper, the opportunities and challenges offered by existing frameworks – including Python libraries, packages, as well as state-of-the-art algorithms like BERT – are discussed, illustrated, and positioned along an ad hoc machine learning process. This contribution discusses the opportunities to reach and the challenges to address for building a machine learning pipeline, in order to get insights from product reviews to design more sustainable products, including the five following stages, from the identification of sustainability-related reviews to the interpretation of sustainable design leads: data collection, data formatting, model training, model evaluation, and model deployment. Examples of sustainable design insights that can be produced out of product review mining and processing are given. Finally, promising lines for future research in the field are provided, including case studies putting in parallel standard products with their sustainable alternatives, to compare the features valued by customers and to generate in fine relevant sustainable design leads.",Data-driven design | Machine learning | Natural language processing | Product reviews | Sustainable design,3,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The present paper investigates and analyzes Amazon product reviews to bring new light on the following question: “What sustainable design insights can be identified or interpreted from online product reviews?”. To do so, the top 100 reviews, evenly distributed by star ratings, for three product categories (laptop, printer, cable) are collected, manually annotated, analyzed and interpreted. For each product category, the reviews of two similar products (one with environmental certification and one standard version) are compared and combined to come up with sustainable design solutions. In all, for the six products considered, between 12% and 20% of the reviews mentioned directly or indirectly aspects or attributes that could be exploited to improve the design of these products from a sustainability perspective. Concrete examples of sustainable design leads that could be elicited from product reviews are given and discussed. As such, this contribution provides a baseline for future work willing to automate this process to gain further insights from online product reviews.

In this study, the standpoints and visions of two consecutive classes of engineering students - following the course ""Circular Economy & Industrial Systems""at the Université Paris-Saclay - are given on how they value CE strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on industrial practices. Capturing and understanding the viewpoints of the engineers of tomorrow on such a pressing issue is key to train and provide them with the suitable methods and tools to build a more circular and sustainable society. At the end of their eight-week training class, including theoretical background on industrial ecology tools, workshops, and a hands-on project, part of the final exam included a one-hour essay in which the students had to argue their position on the following questions: (i) ""Circular Economy as an answer to the COVID-19 crisis?""for the class of 2020, and (ii) ""Circular Economy as an answer for green recovery and value chain resiliency in the COVID-19 context?""for the class of 2021. Interestingly, the evolution of viewpoints between the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis (exam conducted in May 2020 for the first class) and one year after (exam conducted in Mars 2021 for the second class) is discussed and illustrated. Also, the answers and insights provided by engineering students on these questions are positioned within the state-of-the-art literature on the topic.

It was argued that tools built on the idea of design roadmapping have to be very flexible and data-driven (i.e., be able to receive feedback from users in an iterative manner). At the same time, a model-based approach to roadmapping has emerged, promising to achieve such flexibility. In this work, we propose to incorporate design roadmapping to model-based roadmapping and integrate it with various user testing approaches into a single tool to support a flexible data-driven NPD planning process.",New product development | Organisation of product development | Product modelling / models | Strategic management | Technology Roadmapping,0,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Our model is an extension of an exponential distribution case. With the general lifetime distribution, we are able to have total flexibility for setting the lifetime variability.

MaaS is still surrounded by uncertainties and, its development and applicability are mainly centered in developed countries. However, MaaS is modular, adaptable and applicable to several realities. In this sense, this study aims to examine the perception of different transport models among students and to find the profile that can predict respondents' willingness to use MaaS in a developing country. This survey was applied to over 300 university students in a Brazilian city (Lavras). Using the CART algorithm, it was obtained classification trees to predict favourable responses related to MaaS use, based on several predictor variables (socio-economic characteristics, means of transport used, distance and other). It was observed that, car users are a little less sensitive to cost than non-car users. For car users, commute alternatives that take longer, with less flexibility and availability-even when offered at lower costs-are not appealing, while non-car users accept and spend more time whether lower costs are available. Also, in general, the treebased classification model predicted a positive adherence possibility for a MaaS scheme for both car users and non-car users (69%). As conclusions, this study suggests a willingness to MaaS model for creating value for commuters in a developing country. It was found that many MaaS' characteristics (e.g. app payment, transport integration, monthly plan, customization, etc.) presented a positive predicted possibility of substitution, especially for millennials. Also, it was found that bicycle may be a modal that can be explored for MaaS schemes worldwide, and casual carpooling could be used as strategy to apply MaaS in places where the public transport lacks efficiency.",Consumer behaviour | Mobility as a service | Travel behaviour | Tree-based classification model | Urban mobility.,6,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Combining life cycle assessment and life cycle costing methodologies, and by defining adequate functional units, building simulation models, and collecting life cycle inventory data, a systematic comparative study between autonomous and conventional lawn mowers is performed on their environmental and economic impacts. Through this multi-indicator analysis, environmental and economic trade-offs between the autonomous and conventional mowing solutions are quantitatively discussed for key relevant usage scenarios, from mowing an average residential yard to maintaining larger fields like a football stadium or a schoolyard. Concretely, sensitivity analyses on key parameters influencing the performance of the autonomous mower have been conducted to evaluate the environmental and economic benefits of an augmented robotic mower. While optimising the path planning of the current robotic mower would lead to the most substantial savings, improvements on the battery performance, cutting width, and speed of the autonomous solution appear as other promising areas for future work.",Autonomous systems | design improvement | economic analysis | environmental evaluation | sensitivity analysis | sustainability,9,0,,,,undefined,John Deere

These systems will become more flexible and efficient by adapting to the travelers' demand. On the other hand, multi agent systems offer an intuitive and powerful way to design complex distributed systems and agent based simulation has proved to be well suited for studying the performance of mobility services and their impact on the users and the traffic in general. In this study, we use an Agent-Based modeling approach to design a mobility system based on a fleet of autonomous vehicles (robo-taxis and shuttles) and connected road side units, each of these elements represented by intelligent collaborative agents. In our model, the control is distributed among the agents and the global behaviour of the system emerges from local decisions. We then used a microsimulation tool to test the model on the real road network of the Paris-Saclay area. Since this area is planned to become a center for technology, innovation and education and is currently under constant development, it offers an opportunity for the design and the implementation of new models of transportation services. We designed our mobility system in an incremental manner by introducing more components and more intelligent behaviour and testing its performance at each step. Our results suggest that for our area of study, a mobility service that relies on autonomous vehicles aided by connected road side units that allow to retrieve information about the traffic would perform better than a regular service.",agent based simulation | robo-taxis | shared mobility,0,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In this context, this paper proposes an integrated risk assessment framework for an electric power system, considering scenarios that involve the electrified transportation system enabled by EVs charging technology in New York (NY) State. Firstly, scenarios in the transportation network of NY State, e.g. of reduced capacity and incident, are generated by a Monte Carlo non-sequential algorithm. Then, the cell transmission model (CTM) is used to simulate the evolution of the traffic flows under such scenarios. This allows evaluating the spatial-temporal EV charging loads in different areas of the electrified transportation system of NY State. Correspondingly, the running parameters in the studied power system are updated by the alternative current (AC) power flow model. Finally, the risk for the power system coming from the transportation system scenarios is assessed within a probabilistic risk analysis framework. The proposed integrated risk assessment framework is able to model the propagation of the effects of scenarios in the transportation system onto the power system of NY State and quantify the consequences. A real test case is used to illustrate the proposed framework.",Cell transmission model | electric power system | electric vehicles | integrated system | risk assessment | system of systems | traffic congestion | transportation system,63,0,,,CSC,201606990003,China Scholarship Council

One of these promising opportunities is to use the underused assets in people-based systems to transport goods. In this paper, we consider an integrated system in which a set of freight requests needs to be delivered using a fleet of grounded, and autonomous, pickup and delivery (PD) robots where a public transportation service (referred to as scheduled line (SL)) can be used as part of PD robot's journey. Passengers and PD robots (carrying freight) share the available capacity on SLs where passengers are prioritised, and their transport demand is stochastic. Thus the number of available places for PD robots is only revealed upon shuttle arrival to the corresponding SL station. We first formulate this problem as a Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows and Scheduled Lines (PDPTW-SL). We then introduce a sample average approximation (SAA) method along with an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) algorithm for solving the stochastic optimization problem.

The server interacts with customers in a multi-stage process with random durations. Some stages require an interaction between server and customer, while other stages are performed by the customer as a self-service task or with the help of another resource. Random arrivals by customers at the beginning and during an encounter create random lengths of idle time in the work of the server (breaks and interludes respectively). The server considers treatment of an infinite amount of back-office tasks, or tasks that do not require interaction with the customer, during these idle times. We consider an optimal control problem for the server's work. The main question we explore is whether to use the interludes in service encounters for treating back-office, when the latter incur switching times. Under certain operating environments, working on back-office during interludes is shown to be valuable. Switching times play a critical role in the optimal control of the server's work, at times leading the server to prefer remaining idle during breaks and interludes, instead of working on back-office, and at others to continue back-office in the presence of waiting customers. The optimal policy for use of the interludes is one with multiple thresholds depending on both the customers queueing for service, and the ones who are in-service. We illustrate that in settings with multiple interludes in an encounter, if at all, the back-office work should be concentrated on fewer, longer and later interludes.",Case-manager system | Front-office service work | Multitasking | Queueing system control,4,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

These safety barriers, although designed to operate in different phases of the accidents evolution, are often optimized separately, without considering their collective effects on preventing disruptions and quickly recovering from the disruptions. This paper develops a joint optimization model for synthetically optimizing safety barriers of different natures, including prevention, mitigation, emergency and recovery barriers to enhance the business continuity of the NPP, considering the threat of steam generator tube rupture (SGTR) accidents. The joint optimization is guided by a business continuity metric called expected business continuity value (EBCV). A physics-of-failure model is developed to describe the crack growth process of the steam generator tube and to model the effect of the prevention barriers, i.e., periodical inspection of the crack length. An event tree model is developed to describe the evolution of the SGTR-initiated accident and to model the effect of the mitigation and emergency barriers. Recovery measures are also considered via a widely-used logarithmic function model. A mixed-integer genetic algorithm (MIGA) is used to obtain optimal solutions of the joint optimization model. The results show that the developed joint optimization model can achieve better performance in terms of business continuity, compared to the conventional methods that optimize the safety barriers separately.",Business continuity management (BCM) | Event tree (ET) | Joint optimization | Mixed-integer genetic algorithm (MIGA) | Nuclear power plant (NPP) | Safety barrier | Steam generator tube rupture (SGTR),12,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,CSC,201506450020,China Scholarship Council

In the present paper, we develop an extended framework for the analysis of the criticality of assumptions in risk assessment by evaluating the risk that deviations from the assumptions lead to a reduction of the safety margins. The framework aims to support risk-informed decision making by identifying important assumptions and integrating the assessment of their criticality into the quantitative risk assessment (QRA). The framework is, finally applied within the quantitative risk assessment of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) exposed to external flooding. Compared to previous works on the subject, we consider also conservative assumptions and introduce decision flow diagrams to support the classification of the criticality of the assumptions. The framework provides a more comprehensive and transparent evaluation of the assumptions deviation risk through the decision flow diagrams that facilitate the standardization of the evaluation of the assumption deviation effects on the risk assessment.",Assumption deviation | Conservative assumption | Decision flow diagram | External flooding | Nuclear power plants | Quantitative risk assessment | Strength of knowledge,9,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

Distributed battery storage, such as electric vehicles batteries and stationary ones, ranging from around a dozen to a few hundred kWh and photovoltaic (PV) systems are disruptive technologies not only because they can individually contribute to CO2 emissions reduction but also due to the positive synergies between them. Batteries can store electricity surplus produced by PVs during the day, avoiding curtailment, and restore it to the grid to shave peak load or when external grid constraints are identified. We provide an analytical framework identifying the main research areas dealing with PV—EV–battery relationships to academics, stakeholders and policymakers willing to acquire further knowledge on this topic. The coupling between PV—EV–battery depends not only on the technological progress or economic regulations, but also on the under-explored user acceptance towards the technologies. First, emerging technologies (e.g. microgrids, vehicle-to-grid and blockchain) will deeply impact PV–EV–battery synergy, forcing electricity grid operators to readjust the way how the grid is managed. Second, inappropriate economic regulations (e.g obsolete tariff and ancillary services market designs) and outdated strategies formulated by the automotive sector could jeopardize all the potential benefits brought by the coupling. Then, user acceptance is found to be a decisive variable in whether people are willing to invest in distributed energy systems.

An action research approach is conducted in collaboration with an emerging international remanufacturing center of heavy handling machines to bring a contribution to this gap in a circular economy perspective. This industrial pilot study considers the entire end-of-life management of a whole heavy vehicle, from the dismantling to the recovery of used parts, through remanufacturing. It illustrates as such the multiple dimensions to consider when closing-the-loop on heavy vehicles, namely: technical and organizational knowledge (e.g., infrastructures, tooling, dismantling process and remanufacturing feasibility), as well as economic considerations (e.g., solutions to optimize the value recovered according to market needs, through the identification of potential recovery channels). To do so, a multi-scale modeling is proposed, taking into account: (i) the condition of the used vehicle and residual values of key components, (ii) the dismantling process and capabilities, (iii) the possible end-of-life options and associated market. A first dismantling operation on a worn-out 8-ton forklift truck is performed and closely analyzed to identify hotspots and areas for improvement. Based on that and taking inspiration from the best practices of the automotive recycling sector, a new dismantling process is designed including improvement in terms of organisation, resources used, disassembly time, and comfort for the operator. This newly proposed process is then tested and validated through a second dismantling experimentation on a similar forklift truck. Moreover, a practical spreadsheet, to be used by the industrialist, is proposed and applied as a decision-making support tool to compare and select the most appropriate end-of-life pathways for recovered components according to the economic aspects of each circular option, among reuse, remanufacturing and material recovery. Eventually, lessons learnt from this industrial case study open up on broader implications and challenges (e.g., the applicability, generalization and scaling-up of commendable practices from one industrial sector to another) to achieve a more advanced circular economy in the heavy vehicle industry.",Circular economy | Dismantling process | Economic recovery | Heavy vehicles | Industrial case study | Remanufacturing,29,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

It is predicted that the majority of future SAVs would most probably be electric. It is therefore important to understand how limited vehicle range and the configuration of charging infrastructure will affect the performance of shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) services. In this study, we aim to explore the impacts of charging station placement, charging types (including normal and rapid charging, and battery swapping), and vehicle battery capacities on service efficiency. We perform an agent-based simulation of SAEVs across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan area in France. The simulation process features impact assessment by considering dynamic demand responsive to the network and traffic. Research results suggest that the performance of SAEVs is strongly correlated with the charging infrastructure. Importantly, faster charging infrastructure and placement of charging locations according to minimized distances between demand hubs and charging stations result in a higher performance. Further analysis indicates the importance of dispersing charging stations across the service area and its impacts on service effectiveness. The results also underline that SAEV battery capacity has to be selected carefully such that to avoid the overlaps between demand and charging peak times. Finally, the simulation results show that the performance indicators of SAEV service are significantly improved by providing battery swapping infrastructure.",Battery swapping | Charging station placement | Multi-agent simulation | Service performance | Shared autonomous electric vehicle,47,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The hierarchical framework, is, then, quantified in a top-down, bottom-up fashion for assessing the SoK. In the top-down phase, a reduced-order risk model is constructed to limit the complexity and number of basic elements considered in the SoK assessment. In the bottom-up phase, the SoK of each basic element in the reduced-order risk model is assessed based on predefined scoring guidelines and, then, aggregated using a weighted average of “leaf” attributes, where the weights are determined based on the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). The strength of knowledge of the basic events is in turn, aggregated using a weighted average to obtain the SoK for the whole risk assessment model.

This paper models the degradation of SIS final element as a stochastic process. Based on the observed information during a proof test, it is essential to determine an optimal maintenance strategy by choosing a preventive maintenance (PM) or corrective maintenance (CM), as well deciding what degree of mitigation of degradation is enough in case of a PM. When the reasonable initiation situation of a PM and the optimal maintenance degree are identified, lifetime cost of the final element can be minimized while keeping satisfying the integrity level requirement for the SIS. A numerical example is introduced to illustrate how the presenting methods are used to examine the effects of maintenance strategies on cost and the average probability of failure on demands (PFDavg) of a SIS.

Human factors and ergonomics first shifted from the study of physical and medical issues to cognitive issues circa the 1980s. The advent of computers brought with it the development of human-computer interaction (HCI), which then expanded into the field of digital interaction design and user experience (UX). We ended up with the concept of interactive cockpits, not because pilots interacted with mechanical things, but because they interacted using pointing devices on computer displays. Since the early 2000s, complexity and organizational issues gained prominence to the point that complex system design and management found itself center stage, with the spotlight on the role of the human element and organizational setups. Today, human systems integration (HSI) is no longer only a single-agent problem, but a multi-agent research field. Systems are systems of systems, considered as representations of people and machines. They are made of statically and dynamically articulated structures and functions. When they are at work, they are living organisms that generate emerging functions and structures that need to be considered in evolution (i.e. in their constant redesign). This chapter will more specifically focus on human factors such as human-centered systemic representations, life-critical systems, organizational issues, complexity management, modeling and simulation, flexibility, tangibility, and autonomy. The discussion will be based on several examples in civil aviation and air combat, as well as aerospace.",Aeronautical community | Aerospace domain | Flexible autonomy | Human models | Human systems integration | Sociotechnical evolution | Software models,4,0,,,,undefined,

The number of EVs and charging facilities is expected to increase significantly in the near future, making the existing transportation systems increasingly coupled with the electrical power systems. These growing couplings may bring new stresses and risks to both systems. However, the failure of electric vehicles charging facilities have not been considered. In this context, this paper investigates the resilience of an electrified transportation network (ETN) under potential failures of its supporting charging facilities. Specifically, a two-staged system optimal dynamic traffic assignment model is proposed to describe characteristics of an ETN such as the configuration of charging stations, travel ranges of EVs and the state of charge of EVs. This model is based on the cell transmission model (CTM) and two metrics are presented to quantify the ETN performance under the scenario of charging facility failures.

Most of the existing resilience quantification methods assume that the performance level of the system is continuous. A lot of practical energy systems, however, are multistate in nature or needs to be modeled by multistate models to control the modelling/computational complexity (Levitin, 2011). There are only a few works regarding quantifying resilience using multistate models. Thekdi and Chatterjee (2019) developed a multistate hidden Markov model to quantify resilience of infrastructure systems and discussed decision making based on the model. Nuss et al. (2017) used a continuous time discrete state Markov model to quantify the resilience against disruptions considering the multistate engineering system behaviors of unmanned surface vessels to support system design selection during trade studies. In a previous research of the authors (Du et al., 2019), a Markov reward process-based model is developed for quantifying resistant, absorption, recovery and overall resilience. All the above mentioned works are based on Markov (or hidden Markov) models. A significant drawback of these Markov model-based methods is that they have to assume that the transition times among states follow exponential distributions. Practical systems, however, exhibit a variety of time-dependent behaviors, which cannot be adequately described using only exponential distributions. In this paper, we develop a Semi-Markov reward process-based approach to quantify resilience of multistate systems, considering the time-dependent behaviors of both the pre-disruption protection processes and the post-disruption recovery processes. Four numerical metrics are defined to quantify resilience based on the developed model. The model is applied to analyze the resilience of a crude oil storage tank farm.",Multistate system | Resilience | Semi-Markov process | Time-dependent behaviors,0,0,,,,undefined,

The collected data were used to calculate the fleet size, the energy consumption, the emission of particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and the carbon footprint of different shared AEVs in comparison with privately owned ICEVs. The approach shows that the system of a shared AEV fleet could lower externalities (accident avoidance, traffic jams, free spaces, parking costs and lifetime losses) in cities and generate cost benefits for customers.",Autonomous vehicles | Electric vehicles | Frugal innovation | Future mobility | Low carbon economy | Mobility service | Powertrain | Servitisation | Sharing economy | Sustainable mobility | Urban mobility,11,0,,,,undefined,

Most change propagation and failure analysis methods require some knowledge of failure and change probabilities, failure modes, and design parameters, which is difficult to obtain or unavailable to an SoS decision-maker, as component systems are independent in their management and operation. Consequently, this paper uses highlevel SoS functional models and network-based metrics to characterize SoSs functions and assess the functional change and failure of such systems.

We argue that these advanced techniques for managing project risk complexity, notably risk interdependencies, are coherent with the distributed, self-organized nature of agile teams. This new way of structuring and executing Project Risk Management offers the possibility to make decisions more frequently, when needed, with a more distributed authority, and with richer information about anticipation of events and consequences of actions.

Current eco-design methods are not adapted to all the requirements of eco-innovation, because of 1) their complexity of implementation, 2) their low robustness and/or 3) their tendency to provide mostly techno-centred solutions. There is a need to define methods which can support multidisciplinary design teams to eco-innovate. In previous work, a set of seven didactical and meso Eco-ideation Stimulation Mechanisms (ESM) was developed, exploring systemic dimensions related to sustainability currently under-exploited.. The proposition first relies on the co-development of an intuitive and didactic formatting of an ESM toolbox to support the eco-ideation phase in multidisciplinary groups. Second, we propose a method in three main steps implemented in a four-hour workshop: a screening phase with the seven ESMs followed by an in-depth divergent phase with a single mechanism, and a convergent formalization of eco-innovative concepts. We illustrate the eco-innovation method by a real-world case study of an interior agency of a co-working building emphasizing circular economy principles and quality of life at work. A group of 13 stakeholders and experts (architects, eco-design experts, local authority and user representatives) were divided into three groups, facilitated by two researchers.

Specifically, agents involved in the resilience management aim at an optimum process of sequential preparedness/protection, emergency response, recovery, and adaptation activities, trading off the loss due to lack of system functionality with the needed investment. Agents' decisions are made sequentially aiming at minimizing the overall system loss in the presence of numerous uncertainties in the intensity of the disruption, post-disruption demand, repair durations, etc. We restrict the actions to only depend on uncertain parameters realized up to the current decision period. This process can be formulated as a multi-stage optimization problem. We discuss how the linear decision rule approximation can be used to overcome the curse of the computational complexity of the problem and to derive operationally implementable policies. By referring to a simple example of a notional infrastructure, we demonstrate that the proposed approach helps providing a holistic view of resilience management and deriving optimal actions and policies for resilience enhancement.",Infrastructure systems | Multistage decision making | Resilience management,2,0,,,,undefined,

The evaluation is based on two main attributes (criteria), i.e., the strength of knowledge supporting the assessment and the fidelity of the risk assessment model. These two attributes are further broken down into sub-attributes and, finally, leaf attributes. The trustworthiness is calculated using a weighted average of the leaf attributes, in which the weights are calculated using the Dempster Shafer Theory-Analytical Hierarchy Process (DST-AHP). Risk aggregation is, then, performed by a “weighted posterior” method, considering the level of trustworthiness.

HSI is grounded on the coconstruction of technology, organizations, and people's activities and jobs. HSI also requires the association of physics, cognitive engineering, and arts. Physics provides necessary knowledge, rules, and constraints that an engineer needs to build a system that works. Cognitive engineering provides knowledge, rules, and constraints that are necessary to safely, efficiently, and comfortably use a system. However, neither physics nor cognitive engineering provides insights or methods that support creativity. Consequently, arts should be integrated into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to make STEAM (with an ""A"" for arts). In this article, integration will be presented as creativity and abduction. Visualization supports integration by making abstract constructs more tangible and facilitating effective learning. We will see how during the design of what became NASA Space Exploration Vehicle, we worked with artists and cartoonists, who helped us visualize possible scenarios. They first drew cartoons that were displayed around a room and developed animations. We used them not only as tangible visualizations of our concepts but also as mediating representations that integrated multiple participants' views. This article is also based on the experience of International Space University Space Studies Program 2012 where we carried out a project on ""what space can contribute to global STEM education,"" which clearly anticipated the shift from STEM to STEAM. We will advocate that space leaders of tomorrow should physically, cognitively, and creatively investigate a specific planet, that is Earth in addition to the other planets. This development is true for both governmental and commercial space activities.

In this respect, business continuity management (BCM) has been proposed as a comprehensive and proactive framework to prevent the disruptive events from impacting the business operations and reduce their potential damages. Most existing business continuity assessment (BCA) models that numerically quantify the business continuity are time-static, in the sense that the analysis done before operation is not updated to consider the aging and degradation of components and systems which influence their vulnerability and resistance to disruptive events. On the other hand, condition monitoring is more and more adopted in industry to maintain under control the state of components and systems. On this basis, in this work, a dynamic and quantitative method is proposed to integrate in BCA the information on the conditions of components and systems. Specifically, a particle filtering-based method is developed to integrate condition monitoring data on the safety barriers installed for system protection, to predict their reliability as their condition changes due to aging. An installment model and a stochastic price model are also employed to quantify the time-dependent revenues and tolerable losses from operating the system. A simulation model is developed to evaluate dynamic business continuity metrics originally introduced. A case study regarding a nuclear power plant (NPP) risk scenario is worked out to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.",Business continuity management (BCM) | Condition monitoring | Dynamic business continuity assessment (DBCA) | Event tree (ET) | Particle filtering (PF) | Prognostic and health management (PHM),11,1,repositoryam,Green,CSC,201506450020,China Scholarship Council

There is currently some discussions about different ownership models and their consequences. Regarding autonomous vehicles (AVs), two ownership models are being considered for future transportation systems. These are: autonomous vehicles as a public service or individual owning ownership. The first ownership model is based on AVs operating within an on-demand (taxi) service while the second proposes private vehicle ownership combined with offering the AV to other users when not used by its owner and thereby partially financing the vehicle’s acquisition cost. In addition to the ownership model comes the possibility of sharing rides. The main difference when sharing a trip is that an individually-owned vehicle always prioritizes its owner. Based on an existing approach for assessing the potential of predefined meeting points in a ride-sharing service, we develop a method for assessing the sharing potential of those different variants. We consider the number and distance of shared trips, and thus, we evaluate the potentially saved vehicle kilometers. We analyze several ownership and sharing scenarios on a case study for New York and Paris. The results demonstrate that sharing AV trips has the potential of increasing the system-wide matching rate as well as saving up to 25% of the overall traveled distance.",Autonomous vehicles | Meeting points | Optimization | Ownership models | Ride-sharing,11,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

We set out sustainable-mobility scenarios that depend on the geographical contexts of different areas based on 50 mobility offers, including active modes, car-sharing, public transport, etc. To do so we appeal to a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), relying on an original two-step assessment method. We first use the diviz decision-aid tool to obtain a global score for each mobility offer, on the basis of 18 criteria covering the three pillars of sustainable development (economy, environment and society) and the concerns of the mobility actors themselves (historical actors, newcomers, public authorities and users). This step supports mobility management by local authorities, as it makes it possible to rank mobility offers by type of area. Second, we use the MICMAC decision-aid tool to construct the influence and dependency relationships between our 18 criteria. The aim of this step is to identify some relevant criteria that are determinant in a prospective or strategic analysis, in order to consider what could be a development scenario for the future of everyday mobility in various areas.

One of the conceivable mobility services based on driverless cars is shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). This service could merge cabs, carsharing, and ridesharing systems into a singular transportation mode. However, the success and competitiveness of future SAV services depend on their operational models, which are linked intrinsically to the service configuration and fleet specification. In addition, any change in operational models will result in a different demand. Using a comprehensive framework of SAV simulation in a multimodal dynamic demand system with integrated SAV user taste variation, this study evaluates the performance of various SAV fleets and vehicle capacities serving travelers across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan area in France. Also, the impact of ridesharing and rebalancing strategies on service performance is investigated. Research results suggest that the performance of SAV is strongly correlated with the fleet size and the strategy of individual or shared rides. Further analysis indicates that for the pricing scheme proposed in this study (i.e., 20% lower for ridesharing scenario), the standard 4-seats car with shared ride remains the best option among all scenarios. The results also underline that enabling vehicle-rebalancing strategies may have an important effect on both user and service-related metrics.

First, the value chain and related stakeholders are mapped out in an MFA-like model to both facilitate the assessment of stocks and flows, and get a comprehensive view of potential action levers and resources to close-the-loop. Then, through the cross analysis of numerous data sources, two MFA are completed: (i) one general MFA, and (ii) one sector-specific MFA, drawing a distinction between the fate of Pt from (a) light-duty vehicles, under the European Union's End of Life Vehicle Directive 2000/EC/53, and (b) heavy-duty and off-road vehicles. Key findings reveal a leakage of around 15 tons of Pt outside the European market in 2017. Although approximately one quarter of the losses are due to in-use dissipation, 65% are attributed to insufficient collection and unregulated exports. Comparing the environmental impact between primary and secondary production, it has been estimated that halving the leakage of Pt during usage and collection could prevent the energetic consumption of 1.3 × 103 TJ and the greenhouse gases emission of 2.5 × 102 kt CO2 eq. Through the lens of circularity indicators, activating appropriate action levers to enhance the CE performance of Pt in Europe is of utmost importance in order to secure future production of new generations of CC and fuel cells. Moreover, the growing stockpile of Pt from CC in use indicates the need for better collection mechanisms.

The motivation for dealing with this topic is that more and more companies are adopting RTIs in their supply chain, and despite the growing attention that CLSC and RL research have gained during the last years, the focus is still more oriented toward remanufacturing issues. The objectives of this paper are twofold.

Recent studies have pointed out the potential synergies between these technologies, while others have studied the difficulty to design adequate network tariff when some consumers can adopt DERs (prosumers). In this paper, we investigate the combined effect of DERs and EVs on grid cost recovery. To study these effects, we formulate a non-cooperative game between a regulator that sets tariffs to recover grid costs and the four classes of network users depending on whether they are prosumer (resp. EV owners) or not. We study how tariff structures and the levels of EV penetration and prosuming affect tariffs. First, we find that grid cost recovery concerns caused by load-defecting prosumers installing DER can be balanced by the diffusion of EVs in the network. Second, we highlight that EVs and DERs adoptions are conflicting through the network tariff design. In particular, we find that the more a tariff structure gives incentives for DERs, the less beneficial it is for EVs.",Distributed energy resources | Distribution grid | Electric vehicle | Prosumers | Tariff design,37,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Resilience against extreme weather is also becoming an important concern. In this study, a modeling and optimization framework for power systems planning, which considers both operational flexibility and resilience against extreme weather events, is proposed. In particular, a set of piece-wise linear models are developed to capture the impact of extreme heat waves and drought events on the performance of the power generation units and on the system load. A method is, also, proposed to incorporate the impact models within a modified optimal power system planning problem that can adequately accommodate high shares of IRES. The framework is applied to a case study based on real future climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) under different levels of IRES penetration (up to 50%) and severity of the extreme weather events. A sensitivity analysis is conducted for planning under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) that cover the impact of different trajectories of greenhouse gas concentration on future climate. In particular, RCPs with increase in radiative forcing of +8.5 Wm-2, +4.5 Wm-2 and +2.6 Wm-2 of the pre-industrial levels are considered. The results demonstrate that significant improvements in terms of load supply under an extreme heat wave and drought events can be achieved following the resilient planning framework proposed, compared to conventional planning methods. It is also shown how renewable generation units can improve the system performance against those extreme climate events. Moreover, the quantitative assessment indicates an important interaction between the resilience of the system and its flexibility, and the compound impact of failing to consider either aspect in the power system design phase.",Extreme weather events | Operational flexibility | Power system design | Power system resilience | Renewable energy penetration,52,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In this framework, the potential impacts of a specific natural hazard on an infrastructure are first evaluated in terms of failure and recovery probabilities of system components. Then, these are fed into a bi-level attacker–defender interdiction model to determine the critical components whose failures lead to the largest system functionality loss. The proposed framework bridges the gap between the difficulties of accurately predicting the hazard information in classical probability-based analyses and the over conservatism of the pure attacker–defender interdiction models. Mathematically, the proposed model configures a bi-level max-min mixed integer linear programming (MILP) that is challenging to solve. For its solution, the problem is casted into an equivalent one-level MILP that can be solved by efficient global solvers. The approach is applied to a case study concerning the vulnerability identification of the georeferenced RTS24 test system under simulated wind storms.

This survey sets out to review recent research in this area, including different optimization approaches, and to provide guidelines and promising directions for future research. It makes a distinction between prearranged and real-time problem settings and their methods of solution, and also gives an overview of real-case applications relevant to the research area.",Exact and heuristic methods | Optimization | Passenger and freight transportation | Prearranged and real-time ridesharing,161,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In fact, the uncertainties faced by restoration activities, e.g. stemming from subjective estimates of resources and costs, are rarely considered. Thus, the solutions obtained by a deterministic approach may be suboptimal or even infeasible under specific realizations of the uncertainties. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates the effects of uncertain repair time and resources on the post-disruption restoration of critical infrastructure. Two-stage stochastic optimization provides insights for prioritizing the intensity and time allocation of the repair activities with the objective of maximizing system resilience. The inherent stochasticity is represented via a set of scenarios capturing specific realizations of repair activity durations and available resources, and their probabilities. A multi-mode restoration model is proposed that offers more flexibility than its single-mode counterpart. The restoration framework is applied to the reduced British electric power system and the results demonstrate the added value of using the stochastic model as opposed to the deterministic model. Particularly, the benefits of the proposed stochastic method increase as the uncertainty associated with the restoration process grows. Finally, decision-making under uncertainty largely impacts the optimum repair modes and schedule.",Critical infrastructures | Restoration planning | Stochastic programming | System resilience | Uncertainty,87,0,repositoryam,Green,CTI,undefined,Kommission für Technologie und Innovation

The illustrative example showed that reducing CO2 emissions by an average of 0.07% results in an average of 1.2% increase in the total delay cost.

In parallel, mobile phone data have emerged as the largest mobility data source, but are not yet integrated to transport planning models. Currently, transport authorities are lacking a global picture of daily passenger flows on multimodal transport networks. In this work, we propose the first methodology to infer dynamic Origin-Destination flows by transport modes using mobile network data e.g., Call Detail Records. For this study, we pre-process 360 million trajectories for more than 2 million devices from the Greater Paris as our case study region. The model combines mobile network geolocation with transport network geospatial data, travel survey, census and travel card data. The transport modes of mobile network trajectories are identified through a two-steps semi-supervised learning algorithm. The later involves clustering of mobile network areas and Bayesian inference to generate transport probabilities for trajectories. After attributing the mode with highest probability to each trajectory, we construct Origin-Destination matrices by transport mode. Flows are up-scaled to the total population using state-of-the-art expansion factors. The model generates time variant road and rail passenger flows for the complete region. From our results, we observe different mobility patterns for road and rail modes and between Paris and its suburbs. The resulting transport flows are extensively validated against the travel survey and the travel card data for different spatial scales.",Machine learning | Mobile phone data | Origin destination matrix | Transport mode | Travel flows | Urban mobility,103,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The benefit of this flexibility can be however challenged by a new abandonment feature during service. In this context, new flow routing questions arise. How many chats should an agent serve? Which agent should be selected? Or may a chat be served by more than one agent? We aim to answer these questions so as to find the best trade-off between time spent in service, queueing delay and abandonment. For this purpose, we determine conditions under which the traditional Least Busy First or Most Busy First policies are optimal for agent selection. Using a dynamic programming analysis, we prove that a state-dependent threshold reservation policy is optimal when a chat can be handed to other agents without loss of efficiency. This analysis reveals that reservation is useful as it allows to maintain of sufficient agent productivity and abandonment from the queue which in turn reduce the system's congestion. In addition, we show the closeness between the optimal policy and the easier-to-implement fixed capacity policy if this fixed capacity is optimized. When a chat cannot be handed to other agents, we develop a dispatching policy improvement algorithm based on the explicit computation of the relative value function for an initial policy with fixed probabilities. The dispatching policy significantly outperforms non state-dependent ones, as it partly compensates the agents’ inability to share a chat service.",Chat messages | Contact centers | Markov decision process | Multitasking | Queueing systems,12,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The DCFP considered comprises of soft failure processes due to degradation and hard failure processes due to random shocks, where dependency arises due to the abrupt changes to the degradation processes brought by the random shocks. In practice, random shock processes are often unobservable, which makes it difficult to accurately estimate the shock intensities and predict the RUL. In the proposed method, the problem is solved recursively in a two-stage framework: in the first stage, parameters related to the degradation processes are updated using particle filtering, based on the degradation data observed through condition monitoring; in the second stage, the intensities of the random shock processes are updated using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, considering the dependency between the degradation and shock processes, and the fact that no hard failure has occurred. The updated parameters are, then, used to predict the RUL of the system. Two numerical examples are considered for demonstration purposes and a real dataset from milling machines is used for application purposes. Results show that the proposed method can be used to accurately predict the RUL in DCFP conditions.",Degradation | dependent competing failure processes | Markov chain Monte Carlo | particle filtering | prognostics | random shocks | remaining useful life,32,0,repositoryvor,Green,NSFC,61573043,National Natural Science Foundation of China

A planning approach integrating tactical and operational decisions is proposed. Using a rolling horizon, the proposed approach determines the quantities to produce, store and deliver, which minimize the total production and distribution cost. At the tactical planning level, a percentage of production capacity is reserved in order to accommodate replenishment orders that are difficult to predict. Moreover, production of standardized items with predictable demand could be assigned to overseas low-cost sub contractors. For operational planning, local sub contracting and overtime could be used as options to address the unpredict ability of the demand tied to replenishment orders.

New tools are required to support practitioners, decision-makers and policy-makers towards more CE practices, as well as to monitor the effects of CE adoption. Worldwide, academics, industrialists and politicians all agree on the need to use CE-related measuring instruments to manage this transition at different systemic levels. In this context, a wide range of circularity indicators (C-indicators) has been developed in recent years. Yet, as there is not one single definition of the CE concept, it is of the utmost importance to know what the available indicators measure in order to use them properly. Indeed, through a systematic literature review – considering both academic and grey literature – 55 sets of C-indicators, developed by scholars, consulting companies and governmental agencies, have been identified, encompassing different purposes, scopes, and potential usages. Inspired by existing taxonomies of eco-design tools and sustainability indicators, and in line with the CE characteristics, a classification of indicators aiming to assess, improve, monitor and communicate on the CE performance is proposed and discussed. In the developed taxonomy including 10 categories, C-indicators are differentiated regarding criteria such as the levels of CE implementation (e.g. micro, meso, macro), the CE loops (maintain, reuse, remanufacture, recycle), the performance (intrinsic, impacts), the perspective of circularity (actual, potential) they are taking into account, or their degree of transversality (generic, sector-specific). In addition, the database inventorying the 55 sets of C-indicators is linked to an Excel-based query tool to facilitate the selection of appropriate indicators according to the specific user's needs and requirements. This study enriches the literature by giving a first need-driven taxonomy of C-indicators, which is experienced on several use cases. It provides a synthesis and clarification to the emerging and must-needed research theme of C-indicators, and sheds some light on remaining key challenges like their effective uptake by industry. Eventually, limitations, improvement areas, as well as implications of the proposed taxonomy are intently addressed to guide future research on C-indicators and CE implementation.",Circular economy | Circularity indicators | Selection tool | Taxonomy,503,0,repositoryam,Green,,CBT,Ellison Medical Foundation

To fill this gap, we should first analyse the existing IP games with evaluation methods and synthesise their commonalities. Numerous methods have been put forward in the literature to assess digital SGs; however, most of the SGs for IP are board games. That is why we explore in this paper the use of Serious Game Design Assessment (SGDA) framework to analyse IP board games. According to the case study on an open innovation board game, we suggest applying this method to examine the a priori relevance of game elements (components that make up a game system).

Hence, a collaborative PSS exhibits System of Systems (SoSs) characteristics. These systems have previously been introduced as Product Service Systems of Systems (PSSoSs). In this paper, we propose to identify relevant uncertainties in the PSSoS design process.

MaaS is still surrounded by uncertainties: its development and applicability are mainly centered in developed countries; however, we believe that MaaS is modular, adaptable and applicable to several realities. In this sense, this study aims to examine university student’s demand and predisposition for MaaS usage in a developing country, as well as to understand the differences in mobility perception among those students who are car users and non-car users. This survey was applied to over 300 university students in a Brazilian city, Lavras. Using the CART algorithm, we obtained classification trees to predict favorable responses related to MaaS use, based on several predictor variables (socio-economic characteristics, means of transport used, distance, etc.). We observed that car users are a little less sensitive to cost than non-car users. For car users, the commute alternatives that take longer, with less flexibility and availability – even when offered at lower cost – are not appealing, while the non-car users accept alternative options and expend more time when lower costs are available. Also, in general, a tree-based classification model predicted a positive adherence possibility for a MaaS scheme for both car users and non-car users (69%). As conclusions, this study suggests that there is a predisposition to accept the MaaS model for creating value for commuters in a developing country. We found that many MaaS characteristics (e.g. payment via app, transportation integration, monthly plan, customization, and so on) presented a positively predictable possibility of substitution, especially for Millennials. Also, we found that bicycles may be a mode that can be explored for MaaS schemes worldwide, and that hitchhiking could be used as a strategy to apply MaaS in places where public transportation lacks efficiency.",College students | Developing countries | Mobility-as-a-Service | Public transportation | Travel behavior | Tree-based classification model | University students | Urban mobility,3,1,repositoryvor,Green,CAPES,undefined,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior

Furthermore, the insertion of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promises a positive impact on cities’ transit worldwide. Ergo, companies are now combining bundles of products and services emphasizing their “sales of use” rather than of products: such integration may be realized by having multi-sided business platforms. The purpose of this study is to create future scenarios for AV business platforms within urban mobility contexts. Based on an exploratory descriptive qualitative research design, we collected data on academic and grey literature. Four scenarios were plotted with real-world examples currently present in urban mobility cases, extrapolated to a future reality where AVs are considered a transport mode: (A) business-to-consumer (B2C) autonomous ridesharing; (B) P2P autonomous ridesharing; (C) B2C multimodal mobility; (D) B2C + P2P multimodal mobility. Scenarios A and B entail unimodal mobility via autonomous ridesharing, whereupon in the former, a single firm owns a fleet and subsidizes the consumer segment, while in the latter, ordinary peers own the AVs, which are offered to other peers via Uber-like applications. Scenarios C and D entail multimodal mobility from point X to Y, where in the former, a single firm owns the multimodal fleet and subsidizes the consumer segment, while Scenario D offers a bundle of B2C and P2P solutions under the MaaS paradigm. We conclude that in scenarios A and B, value creation can be solely explained by business platforms theory; while in scenarios C and D, business platforms theory is tied to business ecosystem theory, to explain value creation and distribution. Lastly, besides the unlikelihood of scenario C, any of the other three have the potential to become a reality when AVs become an urban transport mode.",Autonomous vehicles | Business platforms | Scenario planning | Traffic | Transportation | Urban mobility | Urban planning,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,CAPES,undefined,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior

This research has been conducted in collaboration with a major car manufacturing company, and in particular in the development process through Modeling and Simulation. The objective is to propose a decision-making model that integrates data-gathering estimation, hence integrating also the estimation of postponing one decision. A decision problem model based upon expected utility combined with the value of information theory is proposed to address this issue. The model has been developed and tested on 4 case studies.

A first formulation of this extended optimization model is given and discussed through an illustrative example.

The energy consumption profile based on social information is modeled as a consumption rescheduling problem, which aims to maximize the benefit of demand-side management. The false price spreading process is described by a multi-level influence propagation model, which takes into account the personalities of the end users. Different attack strategies are considered and the power operator's response is modeled. The residual ampacity of distribution lines and the expected energy not supplied are adopted to quantify the impacts of the attacks on the power system. To account for the stochastic characteristics of the influence propagation process, Monte Carlo simulation is utilized. The proposed modeling and analysis framework is applied on a modified IEEE 13 nodes test feeder and a notional social network.

Current project organizations are generally based on single-criterion decomposition, whether product, process, or organization based. The proposed approach forms complementary clusters of actors based on the interdependencies between the risks they manage. More precisely, distinction has been made between the interdependencies connecting two risks that are owned by different actors and those owned by the same actor. We argue that interdependency between two risks managed by the same actor is less dangerous, meaning that clustering algorithm is tailored to distinguish mono- and biactor risk interdependencies. The complementary structure offered by interdependency-based clustering tends to put together strongly interconnected actors, albeit they were often initially not grouped together. It increases the likelihood of a better communication, coordination, and collective decision-making in complex situations. Some risks remain out of proposed clusters and are declared transverse, which means that their owners act as information hubs and are not involved in a single cluster.

Concepts from different metaheuristics are often hybridized with each other, but they are also often combined with other optimization techniques such as tree-search, dynamic programming and methods from the mathematical programming, constraint programming, and SAT-solving fields. Such combinations aim at exploiting the particular advantages of the individual components, and in fact well-designed hybrids often perform substantially better than their “pure” counterparts.

Electric vehicles are constrained in their service range by their battery capacity, and may require time-consuming recharging operations at some specific locations. Plug-in hybrid vehicles have two engines, an internal combustion engine and an electric engine using a built-in rechargeable battery. These vehicles can avoid visits to recharging stations by switching to fossil fuel. However, this flexibility comes at the price of a generally higher consumption rate and utility cost. To solve this complex problem variant, we design a sophisticated metaheuristic which combines a genetic algorithm with local and large neighborhood search. All route evaluations, within the approach, are based on a layered optimization algorithm which combines labeling techniques and greedy evaluation policies to insert recharging stations visits in a fixed trip and select the fuel types. The metaheuristic is finally hybridized with an integer programming solver, over a set partitioning formulation, so as to recombine high-quality routes from the search history into better solutions. Extensive experimental analyses are conducted, highlighting the good performance of the algorithm and the contribution of each of its main components. Finally, we investigate the impact of fuel and energy cost on fleet composition decisions.

An activity-based framework for quantifying occupant-related energy consumption is proposed. The energy consumption is quantified per domestic activity as a function of households’ socio-demographic and economic attributes. The aggregation of such domestic activity energy consumption provides an accurate estimation of the household energy consumption per daily, monthly and annually periods.

The scholarship has focused on potential synergies when these two technologies are combined, and recent research shows that interactions between photovoltaic generation and electric mobility could decrease the overall burden on power grids, and empower one technology with the other's specificities. Electric vehicles (EV) could use photovoltaic energy (PV) and benefit from cheap carbon-free electricity for charging. In return, PV systems could use the bi-directional flexibility of EV batteries to maximize their self-consumption. As these synergies operate, economic spillovers from these technologies are expected to improve, thus further leveraging their joint deployment. Here we develop a systematic framework to review the various underlying conditions for synergy as they have been studied in the literature. It emerges that this synergy is driven by technical as well as economic factors. First, it happens in the mid-scale spatial configuration (large workplace buildings and charging stations) and less obviously at other scales (eg. households, territories) and in technologically diversified systems.

Third, an organizational reshuffling is computed, based on the double objective of incorporating at best within clusters the critical interactions and the critical complex phenomena.

However, it seems that neither the existing PSS nor SoS literature provides solutions to how to architect such PSS. This paper presents a methodology for architecting PSS-SoS that are driven by technological innovation. The objective is to design PSS-SoS architectures together with their value proposition and business model from an initial technology impact assessment.

Each year, 12 million light vehicles plus 1 million HDOR vehicles reach their end-of-life. In a context of circular economy, following questions are of growing concern. To what extent is the circular economy achieved and implemented in the automotive and HDOR sectors? What industrial practices and regulations are prevalent and commendable in the light of the circular economy? While the end-of-life management of light vehicles − subjected to the ELV Directive 2000/53/EC – is widely studied in literature, the end-of-life stage of HDOR vehicles has been neglected for a long time from a research perspective. To fill this gap, extensive literature survey and in-depth investigations on the industrial ground are conducted. Key factors – i.e. regulations, business models and markets evolution, new and emerging technologies integration – affecting the circular economy performance of automotive and HDOR sectors are analysed. Notably, not only lessons learned from best industrial practices but also remaining challenges for a more circular economy are highlighted. Both industries are compared through the four buildings blocks of the circular economy and the four possible feedback loops defined by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

The framework proposed includes: (i) the formulation of an integrated generation expansion planning (GEP) and unit commitment (UC) model accounting for key short-term technical constraints, (ii) the elaboration of accurate and systematic horizon reduction methods to alleviate the computational burden of the resulting large-sized optimization problems and (iii) the definition of suitable metrics for the operational flexibility assessment of the obtained plans. The framework is applied to a ten year planning horizon of a realistically sized case study representing the national power system of France, under several scenarios of RES penetration levels and carbon limits, spanning levels of up to 50%. The importance of incorporating the detailed short-term constraints within long-term planning models is shown. The results of the assessment show that, under high renewable energy penetration, neglecting the short-term constraints may lead to plans significantly short on flexibility, reaching shortage levels of up to 50% in frequency and several GWs in magnitude. Also, the load not served reaches levels of up to 3% and carbon emission is underestimated by up to 60%. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of relying on suitable quantitative metrics for operational flexibility assessment in power systems planning rather than solely relying on generic performance measures, such as system costs and mixes of power plants, which are shown not to sufficiently reflect the flexibility levels of the obtained plans.",Flexibility metrics | Generation expansion planning | Operational flexibility | Optimization | Renewable energy penetration | Unit commitment,61,0,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Transferring some of this heat to nearby industrial sinks could lead to a reduction in fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

The regional and sectoral distribution of relevant facilities is then analysed using spatial mapping methods. Lastly, a techno-economic model is built to assess the feasibility of transferring steam sourced from nuclear plants to industrial users. Compare to on-site steam generation, power plant-sourced steam supply could reduce energy supply costs and CO2 emissions in locations close to these plants. Optimum relocation of factories could make steam exchanges more cost-effective, and such considerations should be incorporated in future local planning strategies.",Energy symbiosis | France | Industry | Nuclear | Spatial analysis | Techno-economic modelling,5,0,,,,undefined,

To address this issue, we develop a dynamic risk assessment (DRA) method that allows online estimation of risk indexes using data collected during operation. Two types of data are considered: statistical failure data, which refer to the counts of accidents or near misses from similar systems and condition-monitoring data, which come from online monitoring the degradation of the target system of interest. For this, a hierarchical Bayesian model is developed to compute the reliability of the safety barriers and a Bayesian updating algorithm, which integrates particle filtering (PF) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo, is developed to update the reliability evaluations based on both the statistical and condition-monitoring data. The updated safety barriers reliabilities, are, then, used in an event tree (ET) for consequence analysis and the risk indexes are updated accordingly. A case study on a high-flow safety system is conducted to demonstrate the developed methods. A comparison to the DRA method which only uses statistical failure data shows that by introducing condition-monitoring data on the system degradation process, it is possible to capture the system-specific characteristics, and, therefore, provide a more complete and accurate description of the risk of the target system.",Condition-monitoring | dynamic risk assessment (DRA) | event tree (ET) analysis | hierarchical Bayesian model | Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) | particle filtering (PF),59,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

From the confrontation of theory and practice, the actual potential of nuclear power is analysed, both at the reactor scale and the fleet scale. The data shows that, today, nuclear reactors are flexible, and are currently operated in France as such (approximately 40% of the fleet is currently involved in load-following).

Firstly, the linear heat density of the modelled DH networks was determined, including locations with poorly developed DH networks. A large potential for extending DH networks was identified for France and the United Kingdom despite the expected decrease in the heat demand due to building renovation. Secondly, the costs and GHG emissions of DH + NCHP systems were evaluated via a cost-benefit analysis. It concluded that 7 of the 15 projects would be cost-effective if 25% of the total urban heat demand was supplied.

Inbound calls have a non-preemptive priority over outbound jobs. The inbound call service is characterized by three successive stages where the second one is a break; i.e., there is no required interaction between the customer and the agent for a non-negligible duration. This leads to a new opportunity to efficiently split the agent time between inbound calls and outbound jobs. We focus on the optimization of the outbound job routing to agents. The objective is to maximize the expected throughput of outbound jobs subject to a constraint on the inbound call waiting time. We develop a general framework with two parameters for the outbound job routing to agents. One parameter controls the routing between calls and the other performs the control inside a call. We then derive structural results with regard to the optimization problem and numerically illustrate them. Various guidelines to call center managers are provided. In particular, we prove for the optimal routing that at least one of the two outbound job routing parameters has an extreme value.",blending | Call centers | Markov chains | optimization | performance evaluation | queueing systems | routing | task overlapping | waiting times,7,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

They are compared with electric boilers and central gas boilers in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and heating costs. The heating systems are dimensioned to supply the projected 2030 heat loads for two different land surface areas (extensive and compact). The key input data is the empirical residential and tertiary heat demand per square kilometre for 2015, extrapolated to 2030 to account for the potential decrease in the heat demand (energy-efficient buildings). Given the assumptions made in this paper, the heating system that obtains the best balance between CO2 emissions and heating cost relies on an NCHP located about 30 km from Lyon. Cases in which the heat has to be transported over longer distances are considered, hence providing insights for metropolitan areas with similar size and density as the Lyon area.

Most existing CCF models assume that the component failure behavior does not vary over time. Such an assumption is often challenged in practice due to the influence of various degradation mechanisms, e.g., wear, corrosion, fatigue, etc. In this paper, we develop a new model for CCFs considering components degradation. The model is developed in the mathematical framework of Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS). The CCFs are modeled as random shock processes that affect a group of components simultaneously and the components degradation processes are modeled by stochastic differential equations derived from physics-of-failures. The benefit of using the SHS model for CCFs is that the developed model is analytically solvable. The system reliability can, then, also be solved analytically in closed form. The proposed CCF modelling framework is demonstrated by a numerical example of a three-unit redundant system and, then, applied to an Auxiliary Feedwater Pump (AFP) system of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). A comparison to the Binomial Failure Rate (BFR) model of literature shows that by considering the components degradation processes, the proposed model can accurately describe the CCF effect on the reliability of a system with degrading components.",Binomial failure rate model | Common-cause failures | Component degradation | Monte Carlo simulation | Random shocks | Stochastic hybrid systems,31,0,,,NSFC,61573043,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Evaluating such designs through conventional life tests is difficult as the affordable test time is too short to generate a meaningful amount of failure data. In this paper, we design and implement an accelerated life test (ALT) for evaluating the reliability of pneumatic cylinders. From a detailed analysis of failed samples from field operation, the major failure mechanisms that affect the reliability of pneumatic cylinders are identified, e.g., wear and tear of sealing rings. For these failure mechanisms, temperature and frequency are found out to be the significant stresses of the pneumatic cylinders. A two-factor-four-level full-factor design of ALT is, then, performed to set up an ALT plan for the pneumatic cylinders. A total number of 95 samples are tested according to the ALT plan, and a mixed Arrhenius-inverse-power-law model is used to fit the test data and predict the reliability under normal operation conditions. In addition, a normal stress test of eight samples is performed to validate the reliability predicted by the ALT. The results show that using the proposed ALT, the reliability of the pneumatic cylinder can be predicted with satisfactory accuracy. It is also shown that the designed ALT plan requires only 38.77% of the testing effort of other conventional life tests.",Accelerated life test | data analysis | failure mechanisms | pneumatic cylinders | reliability,8,1,repositoryam,Green,CSC,201706025028,China Scholarship Council

A qualitative data analysis was performed to understand the difficulties and the needs expressed by decision makers. Industrial preliminary observations have shown that decisions regarding design issues are often postponed, causing iterations, and time and cost overruns in the development process. The study revealed that decisions are escalated to upper hierarchical levels as complexity and uncertainty increase and as the tradeoffs become impactful. A lack of knowledge about the M&S performance and limits, a lack of clarity due to design ambiguity, and uncertainty are more likely to cause iterations and delay.

The main drivers to change regulatory institutions are the 'evaluative criteria' applied to outcomes. Evaluative criteria are rule-makers' simplified models against which outcomes are evaluated. We look at the emergence of dominant organisational structures, and point at the importance of the institutional design in such process. In particular, we analyse the interaction between policy choices: we consider policy makers that have two main dimensions upon which to act: they may facilitate cooperative strategies, or they may implement demand-side measures.",Co-evolution | Electric vehicles | Institutional evolution | Path-dependence,3,0,,,,undefined,Solar Technologies go Hybrid

To change this, we propose a structured methodology, Radical Innovation Design (RID), which supports designers who want to work on the unstated needs of potential end users in order to create superior value. In this article, the first part of RID is introduced with its two subprocesses: Problem Design and Knowledge Design. In this first period, RID guides innovators to systematically explore users' problems and evaluate which ones are most pressing in terms of innovation, taking into account existing solutions. The result is an ambition perimeter, composed of a set of value buckets, that is, important usage situations where major problems are experienced and the current solutions provide little or no relief. The methodology then moves on to Solution Design and Business Design (which are not detailed in this article) to address the value buckets identified. With its emphasis on problem exploration, RID differs from methods based on early prototyping. The RID methodology has been validated in various industrial sectors and is well-adapted for healthcare innovation. To exemplify the methodology, we present a case study in dental imagery performed by 10 students in 8 weeks. This example demonstrates how RID favours efficiency in Problem Design and allows designers to explore unaddressed and sometimes undeclared user needs.",front-end of innovation | innovation methodology | need-seeker innovation | problem definition | value bucket,4,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

By explicitly modeling thewaiting time of the first customer in line, we obtain a natural bounded jump Markov process allowing for uniformization. This approach is useful to solve, via dynamic programming, various optimization problems where the objectives and/or constraints involve the distributions of the performance measures, not only their expected values.

New sources of reserves can be found in distributed energy resources: controllable loads, Electric Vehicles (EVs), distributed generation units. However, it is necessary to adapt the frequency-regulation reserve market design to allow these new resources to participate through new market players known as “aggregators”. The aim of this paper is to provide a modular framework to analyze frequency regulation markets or mechanisms in order i) to identify barriers to entry for aggregators and ii) to identify some options to overcome these barriers. A case study of the situation in 2016 of four major European frequency regulation markets is performed to show how this framework could be used by aggregators or policy-makers.",Distributed energy resources | Frequency regulation services | Market design,55,0,,,,undefined,

It is a strategic decision that reports to the project manager and a key element to the success of complex projects. Based on the modeling of the project elements and their interactions using weighted directed graphs, this article presents some contributions to anticipate potential behavior of the project. Topological and propagation analyses are made to detect and prioritize critical elements and critical interdependencies while enlarging the sense of the polysemous word “critical.” We recommend a set of topological indicators suitable for project elements and interactions, which mainly allow us to discuss “How the impact of a project element affects other elements within the network? What is the collective influence of this element?”. These indicators permit to prioritize project elements and their interactions by detecting the most influential ones taking into account the network structure. For instance, they permit to evaluate the collective criticality of project deliverables and to re-evaluate the priority of the risks associated with these deliverables by coupling the traditional features of individual risks with the topological indicators of the deliverables. Furthermore, some algorithms are applied to extract and visualize the propagation path between two elements within the network. For example, this allows to provide a vision of potential impact propagation between two project deliverables, either they are associated with two milestones or are critical. An application to automotive industry illustrates the benefits of the approach, and some perspectives are drawn for further work.",Criticality analysis | Design structure matrix | Project deliverables | Propagation analysis | Topological indicators,9,0,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,
