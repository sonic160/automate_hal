Electric vehicles can represent additional load for the power system, but can also bring new opportunities for contributing to the efficient and resilient operations of the power grid. This is mainly because of their ability to provide back power to the system when it is not used for transportation, essentially serving as a moving battery source for the power grid. This so-called Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), Vehicle-to-Building (V2B), or, generally, Vehicle-to-X (V2X) capability of EVs has been extensively studied in the literature. However, the upcoming development of autonomous driving systems and their integration within sharing mobility services can significantly add to the possibilities of interaction between the transportation system and the power grid. This paradigm is studied to a much lesser extent in the existing literature. Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicles (SAEVs) could allow for more control of the actions of the fleet allowing for large-scale coordinated responses both to mobility and energy demands. This coordinated response can be particularly useful for providing emergency power services in case of power loss while maintaining a high level of transportation service. Thus, improving the overall resilience of the system. In this work, we develop a dynamic optimization framework to evaluate the potential contribution of the SAEV fleet for improving critical buildings’ energy resilience via V2B services. The model considers passengers’ pick-up and transportation, relocation of vehicles, and battery charging and discharging. Power outage scenarios for critical buildings are considered and the potential of the SAEV fleet to fully or partially respond to the emergency power outage is studied. In addition, sensitivity analysis for key parameters such as the outage parameters is introduced. The results of the case study for the Ile-de-France region in France shows that the SAEV fleet has the potential to provide V2B service for critical building at an acceptable loss of passenger total waiting time on the transportation side. Furthermore, it is shown that it is capable of satisfying the emergency power load at a lower cost compared to investing in extra backup generators unless the outage occurs at significantly high frequencies.",Autonomous electric vehicles | Model predictive control | Resilience of complex systems | Rolling horizon optimization | Vehicle-to-building,0,0,,,,undefined,,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

Currently, most existing works on DRA in O&G industry mainly rely on event-driven data, such as failures or accident data from similar systems for risk updating. These data can be collected only when accidents or near-misses have occurred, which limits the prediction capability of the DRA model. To address this drawback, a DRA model is developed in this paper that uses condition-monitoring data for risk updating. A significant advantage of using condition-monitoring data is that the risk can be updated before accidents or failures occur, giving the operation team more time to take preventive actions. The developed approach comprises of an offline and an online phase. In the offline phase, a conventional risk assessment is performed based on fault tree models to calculate the risks at the beginning of the operation. Through the offline analysis, we can also identify the most critical safety barriers by examining their contribution to the risk indexes. Critical safety barriers are selected for condition-monitoring. In the online phase, the condition-monitoring data are used to update the reliability of the safety barriers in real-time based on a sequential Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm using a Bayesian framework. The updated reliabilities of the safety barriers are, then, used in the offline risk assessment model for a DRA. The developed approach is applied for a DRA of liquid carryover from an oil and gas separator to downstream equipment, using real-time data from the separator's safety barriers. The results show that the developed method provides a more accurate representation of the system's performance, enabling early detection of potential failures and reducing uncertainty in risk estimates. The proposed DRA model demonstrated its effectiveness in predicting failures of safety barriers in real-time, giving operational teams ample opportunity to take corrective action. This leads to improved decision-making in the O&G industry, enabling timely response to changes in risk levels. The use of condition-monitoring data enhances the accuracy of risk estimations, representing a crucial advance in DRA applications in the O&G sector.",Condition-monitoring | Dynamic risk analysis | Process safety | Risk analysis | Safety analysis,0,0,,,EDF,ANR-22CE10–0004,Elizabeth Dole Foundation,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

Analyzing vulnerability characteristics of DHNs is of great significance in heating safety decision-making. In this study, we analyze the structure, function, operation, and failure characteristics of DHNs and propose vulnerability analysis methods. We develop failure simulation models under fully-controllable (FC) and uncontrollable (UC) conditions for six failure scenarios based on component importance. To verify the proposed methods' effectiveness, we applied them to a DHN in a Chinese city. Upon analyzing the appositeness of various vulnerability assessment indicators, we find that the heat source connectivity efficiency loss rate, established based on hydraulic distribution in DHNs, can effectively characterize both topological and functional vulnerability. Our analysis also reveals that controllable DHNs, which evenly distribute heat supply among connected users for fairness, can result in lower flow and greater functional vulnerability compared to UC DHNs. In particular, under large area failure (AF) scenarios, the average functional vulnerability of UC DHNs increases by 27.59% to 38.30% compared to small-AF scenarios, while that of controllable DHNs increases by 103.78% to 120.58%.

Various characteristics of the branched and looped structure are studied in their influence on system vulnerability, based on which several design criteria for single-source DHNs are deduced. Specifically, single-source branched DHNs shall be designed as symmetrical to avoid long pipelines bearing enormous heat loads. When transforming the branched DHNs into looped DHNs, priority should be given to adding cotrees between the intermediate nodes of high importance, and the diameters of looped pipes should be enlarged.

As a matter of fact, AI cyber security is becoming an important aspect to ensure space safety and operational security. Apart from identifying new vulnerabilities that AI systems may introduce to space assets, this paper seeks for safety guidelines and technical standardisations developed for terrestrial applications that can be applicable to AI systems in space. Existing policy guidance for cybersecurity and AI, especially for the European context, is discussed. To promote the safe use of AI technologies in space this work underlines the urgency for policymakers, governance, and technical institutions to initiate or further support the development of a suitable framework to address the new cyber-vulnerabilities introduced by AI technologies when applied to space systems.

In the proposed methodology, emergency response systems are viewed as multi-step emergency operations for STAMP to analyze the hierarchical control and feedback structures. The output of multi-stage STAMP in controllers, actuators, sensors, and controlled processes is applied to develop a DBN for resilience assessment. For known external shocks (e.g., natural disasters), the effects of external shocks on the system are decomposed into subsystems or components. System degradation and recovery models are established. Regarding unknown external disruption (e.g., unforeseen failure modes), degeneration and recovery are temporally integrated into the analysis of system functionality. System performance is evaluated through the combination of socio-technical factors and external disasters. Eventually, the resilience of emergency response systems is obtained from the performance curves.

While long timescale traffic variation can be easily predicted based on historical data, short timescale abnormal traffic is hard to forecast yet can significantly violate the service requirements. The impact of short timescale traffic variation can be mitigated by 5G management and control systems. However, the complexity and dynamics of the virtualized 5G system make it hard to estimate its resilience. This paper provides a 5G network model that captures the data traffic changes and network dynamic management mechanism. The model is able to evaluate the performance of different network services with different requirements under traffic variation events.

These prognostics are further integrated into maintenance planning, both for single and multiple components. We illustrate our approach for aircraft turbofan engines. The results show that the optimal replacement time for the engines is close to the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval of the RUL estimates. We also show that our proposed maintenance approach leads to a cost reduction of 53% compared to a traditional Time-based maintenance strategy. Moreover, compared with the ideal case when the true RUL is known in advance (perfect RUL prognostics), our approach leads to a limited number of failures. Overall, this paper proposes an end-to-end framework for data-driven predictive maintenance for multiple components, and showcases the potential benefits of data-driven predictive maintenance on cost and reliability.",Aircraft | C-MAPSS turbofan engines | Maintenance scheduling | Predictive maintenance planning | Probabilistic remaining useful life prognostics,9,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,EDF Energy,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

Condition-based maintenance (CBM) leverages the current degradation condition of the studied object to optimize future maintenance interventions. CBM optimization problems are complex for multi-component systems, facing the issue of the curse of dimensionality brought by the increase in the number of components. Reinforcement learning provides a promising perspective to overcome the issue. In this paper, we studied CBM optimization for a multi-component system in which the components degrade subject to the gamma process independently. We considered multiple maintenance choices for individual components, leading to a large combinatorial action space. In this case, traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms like DQN may struggle to face the inefficiency of exploration. Instead, we propose exploiting Branching Dueling Q-network (BDQ), which incorporates the action branching architecture into DQN to drastically decrease the number of estimated actions. We trained a learning agent to minimize the expected cost for a long time horizon by taking maintenance actions according to the observed exact degrading signal for each component. We compared the policy learned by the agent with some other pre-defined static policies.

Traditional PF is a recursive Bayesian filtering framework that updates the posterior probability density function of RULs when new observation data become available. In engineering practice, due to the limited accuracy of monitoring/inspection techniques, the observation data available for PF are inevitably imprecise and often need to be treated as interval data. In this article, a novel Interval Particle Filtering (IPF) approach is proposed to effectively leverage such interval-valued observations for RUL prediction. The IPF is built on three pillars: (i) an interval contractor that mitigates the error explosion problem when the epistemic uncertainty in the interval-valued observation data is propagated; (ii) an interval intersection method for constructing the likelihood function based on the interval observation data; and (iii) an interval kernel smoothing algorithm for estimating the unknown parameters in the IPF. The developed methods are applied on the interval-valued capacity data of batteries and fatigue crack growth data of railroad tracks.

Most of the existing works on selective maintenance assumed that after each mission, the components’ states can be precisely known without additional efforts. In engineering scenarios, the states of the components in a system need to be revealed by inspections that are usually inaccurate. Inspection activities also consume the limited resources shared with maintenance activities. We, thus, put forth a novel decision framework for selective maintenance of partially observable systems with which maintenance and inspection activities will be scheduled in a holistic and interactively sequential manner. As the components’ states are partially observable and the remaining resources are fully observable, we formulate a finite-horizon Mixed Observability Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) model to support the optimization. In the MOMDP model, both maintenance and inspection actions can be interactively and sequentially planned based on the distributions of components’ states and the remaining resources. To improve the solution efficiency of the MOMDP model, we customize a Deep Value Network (DVN) algorithm in which the maximum mission success probability is approximated. A five-component system and a real-world multi-state coal transportation system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is shown that the probability of the system successfully completing the next mission can be significantly increased by taking inspections into account.

In this paper, we propose a new pandemic resource allocation model for allocating limited disease detection and control resources, in particular testing capacities, in order to limit the spread of a pandemic. The proposed model is a novel epidemiological compartmental model formulated as a non-linear programming model that is suitable to address the inherent non-linearity of an infectious disease progression within the population. A number of novel features are implemented in the model to take into account important disease characteristics, such as asymptomatic infection and the distinct risk levels of infection within different segments of the population. Moreover, a method is proposed to estimate the vulnerability level of the different communities impacted by the pandemic and to explicitly consider equity in the resource allocation problem. The model is validated against real data for a case study of COVID-19 outbreak in France and our results provide various insights on the optimal testing intervention time and level, and the impact of the optimal allocation of testing resources on the spread of the disease among regions.

To achieve a rational result, experts from different areas should be involved, and the uncertainties in their assessments should be properly addressed. Such information is often referred to as multisource imprecise information (MSII) and might contain high degree of conflicts, as different experts usually have different expertise and knowledge. Properly quantifying the conflicts among the MSII, then, becomes a critical issue, as the subsequent processing of MSII (e.g., combination and calibration), depends on the degree of conflict in the MSII. To this end, a new conflict measure is put forth based on the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) to quantify and visualize the conflict in the MSII from a group of experts. In the first place, the MSII from each expert is used to construct the basic belief assignment (BBA) of the reliability estimates for the corresponding expert under the DST. A 2-D conflict measure, which combines the conflict factor and Jousselme distance in DST, is, then, proposed to measure the conflict between the experts' BBAs. The conflict is quantified from two perspectives, viz., mutual conflict and total conflict. Finally, a Bhattacharyya distance-based method is developed to further quantify the informativeness of each expert's MSII to the system reliability estimate.

A softmax classifier with cross-entropy loss is used to predict pseudo labels for unlabeled target domain training samples. Compared to traditional transfer learning models that only reduces the global inter-domain difference between two domains, the strength of our model is that both the intra and inter-class domain difference are reduced. Curriculum pseudo labeling (CPL) is further applied to dynamically adjust thresholds for different classes during training phases.

In this paper, the flight delay prediction problem is investigated from a network perspective (i.e., multi-airport scenario). To model the time-evolving and periodic graph-structured information in the airport network, a flight delay prediction approach based on the graph convolutional neural network (GCN) is developed in this paper. More specifically, regarding that GCN cannot take both delay time-series and time-evolving graph structures as inputs, a temporal convolutional block based on the Markov property is employed to mine the time-varying patterns of flight delays through a sequence of graph snapshots. Moreover, considering that unknown occasional air routes under emergency may result in incomplete graph-structured inputs for GCN, an adaptive graph convolutional block is embedded into the proposed method to expose spatial interactions hidden in airport networks. Through extensive experiments, it has been shown that the proposed approach outperforms benchmark methods with a satisfying accuracy improvement at the cost of acceptable execution time. The obtained results reveal that deep learning approach based on graph-structured inputs have great potentials in the flight delay prediction problem.",Flight delay prediction | graph convolutional neural network | graph-structured information | time-evolving airport network,18,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

Finding an optimal protection plan often takes the form of a multilevel optimization problem. Recently, approaches based on distributionally robust optimization (DRO) have gained the attention of many scholars. In fact, DRO allows protecting the decision-maker from the ambiguity arising from the imprecisely identified probability distributions of the failure scenarios. In this framework, the probability distribution of the failure scenarios is assumed to be known ambiguously, and contained in an ambiguity set defined by moment-based conditions. In practice, some decisions taken in the protection plan affect the conditions of the ambiguity set. We refer to this situation as DRO with endogenous uncertainty. In this paper, we study the impact of the endogenous uncertainty on the optimal protection plan of a power network, using a numerical example built upon the IEEE 14-bus system with a traditional moment-based ambiguity set.",critical infrastructures | distributionally robust optmization | moment-based ambiguity set | optimal protection | Power network,0,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

We consider a single-unit system, subjected to random degradation and failures, and for which the current degradation state can be partially observed via an imperfect monitoring system. The system state space is finite, and we model the following maintenance operations: i) perfect inspection, ii) preventive maintenance and iii) corrective maintenance. The goal is to optimize the maintenance policy by taking into account the imperfect monitoring data in order to minimize the expected discounted maintenance cost over an infinite time horizon. We formulate the problem as a POMDP where, at each time step, it should be decided whether or not to conduct a maintenance operation, and if so, which one. To keep the model general and flexible, we suppose that monitoring data are collected every K time steps (i.e. one observation epoch). The model is completed by a constraint imposing that only one maintenance operation can be conducted per observation epoch. Eventually, we solve it using a PBVI algorithm. The value function is approximated by interpolation of grid data points, and new relevant points are dynamically added into the grid where they most improve the value function. This approach is compared to a POMDP modeling based on approximate sample paths (ASP); when evaluated in different cost scenarios, the proposed approach systematically finds better maintenance policies for a comparable computation time. The computation of a lower bound finally proves that we are able to get the optimal value of the problem with satisfying precision.",condition-based maintenance | imperfect monitoring | optimal maintenance planning | partially observable Markov decision process | point-based value iteration,1,1,repositoryam,Green,EDF,undefined,Electricité de France,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

For this reason, recently few studies have started to investigate the vulnerability of a highly coupled traffic-power system in the presence of disruptive events. Actually, however, only very few of these studies have considered the impact of EVs on the interdependent traffic-power system during restoration from a disruptive event. In an attempt to fill this gap, in this study, we investigate the restoration planning of both independent RNs and PNs, and interdependent traffic-power systems. A mixed integer program model is formulated to provide optimal reconfiguration and operational solutions for post-disruption traffic-power systems recovery. The objective of the model is to minimize the total cost incurred by system performance loss, which is quantified by the cumulative unmet traffic demand for RNs and load shedding cost for PNs. Several reconfiguration strategies are considered, including links reversing in RNs and line switching in PNs, to optimize system resilience. In the proposed model, the integrated problem of system optimal dynamic traffic assignment and optimal power flow is solved to derive the optimal traffic-power flow. RNs and PNs are coupled through the coordinately allocated spatio-temporal charging demand of EVs. A partial highway network in North Carolina (NC), USA, and a modified IEEE-14 bus system are used to illustrate the application of the model.

Within this framework, a novel linear optimization model is proposed for the first time to solve the system optimal dynamic traffic assignment problem of ERN. The characteristics considered in the modeling framework include the location, capacity, and charging speed of FCSs, as well as the driving range, charging time, and state of charge (SoC) of EVs.

A second-stage model is, then, extended to minimize the total travel time after the stochastic occurrence of FCS failures, that is, in the failure and recovery phases. Two metrics are considered to quantify the ERN performance and the impacts of FCS failures. A numerical example is studied to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework for analyzing ERN resilience.

If these situations are not considered, it will lead to large fluctuations in estimated SOC and accumulation of estimated errors at continuous time steps To solve these problems, an estimator combining multichannel convolutional and bidirectional recurrent neural networks (MCNN-BRNN) is proposed for SOC estimation. Specifically, MCNN can extract multiscale local robust features that are invariant to perturbations from measurements on different input paths reducing the estimation fluctuations and enhancing the robustness of the estimator. Moreover, a global convolutional layer is designed to learn the intercorrelations of multiscale features and preserve their temporal coherence. By this means, BRNN can capture the effective time-varying information of intercorrelated features in the forward and reverse directions to sequentially estimate SOC, thus alleviating the error accumulation and improving the overall estimation accuracy.

The genetic algorithm is one of the most frequently used method for solving redundancy optimization problems.

The uncertainty of electricity demand and renewable power generation is taken into account through bounded intervals, with parameters that permit control over the level of conservatism of the solution. The multistage robust optimization model allows the sequential representation of uncertainty realization as they are revealed over time. It also guarantees the non-anticipativity of future uncertainty realizations at the time of decision-making, which is the case in practical real-world applications, as opposed to two-stage robust and stochastic models. To render the resulting multistage robust problem tractable, decision rules are employed to cast the uncertainty-based model into an equivalent mixed integer linear (MILP) problem. The re-formulated MILP problem, while tractable, is computationally prohibitive even for moderately sized systems. We, thus, propose a solution method relying on the reduction of the information basis of the decision rules employed in the model, and validate its adequacy to efficiently solve the problem.

Recently, AI has come into extensive use in spacecraft operations, for example to support highly efficient operations of satellite constellations. This ranges in applications from relative positioning, Earth Observation, autonomous navigation, and end-of-life management, among others. While the importance of AI is rising for new space assets, AI is vulnerable to cyber threats, and AI cyber security is becoming an important aspect of space safety and operational security. This work aims to identify the vulnerabilities that AI systems may introduce to space assets and to analyse the potential operational threats and effective technological and regulatory mitigation measures. Towards this goal, the paper first examines and differentiates between vulnerabilities in legacy space systems, and those that are particularly related to AI technologies. The analysis covers the definition of AI technology as well as a detailed discussion about its current use in space related applications. Secondly, a comparison between prevailing cyber-attacks in space and cyber-attacks targeting AI technologies is made. Based on this assessment, the paper recommends prevention and mitigation measures that are contingent on cyber resilience of space operations focusing on AI-based space applications.",Artificial Intelligence | Cyber-vulnerabilities | Mitigation | Prevention | Space Applications,1,0,,,,undefined,,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

A vessel not knowing its position while navigating in the Arctic may find itself in a critical situation. In the framework of the 2nd CASSINI Hackathon aimed to promote ideas based on safe passage in the Arctic, the authors developed a product called North Star. The aim of North Star is using Earth Observation data provided by Galileo and Copernicus services to improve navigation in the Arctic. It consists of an on-board neural engine, the AI Pilot, which searches for and identifies a safe route for the user. The neural engine can be trained on the Copernicus data from the Sentinel constellation, which includes information such as ice thickness, iceberg distribution, wind speed direction, and wave height for a specific passage. In the event of a satellite signal loss, the AI Pilot reuses the information received from Galileo up to that point and integrates them with the vessel's own maritime sensors to maintain the viability of the projected route. The idea behind the AI Pilot is that when a vessel is within communication range with other North Star vessels, they form an ad-hoc mesh network of data collectors with edge computing capabilities. The creation of a mesh network can provide augmented data to the entire GNSS ecosystem. While shipping transportation of oil and gas across the Arctic passages undergoes more strict regulations, private tourism and charter yacht operators in the Arctic are an emerging market due to the relatively unsafe travel conditions. North Star can have a beneficial impact on the tourist sector in the first place, extending afterwards to support Search and Rescue operations, as well as contributing to the protection of the environment and the Arctic fauna. This research presents the concept of operations of North Star, as well as its high-level description from the technical perspective. The potential of this business case is further investigated, to include a roadmap of services offered until the return of investment, potential customers, and current competitors.",Arctic Ocean | Artificial Intelligence | Copernicus Services | Maritime Navigation | Sensor Fusion | Tourism,0,0,,,EC,undefined,European Commission,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

In this article, we propose an improved deep learning-based fault diagnosis framework for EMAs based on triplet network with coupled cluster losses. Unlike the traditional approaches, the proposed framework learns to predict similarity between samples, rather than the fault labels directly. The trained model is used to calculate the distance between testing samples and a set of benchmark samples with known labels. Fault diagnosis is, then, conducted based on the $K$-nearest neighbor algorithm. Experiments on a real-world EMA dataset from NASA show that the developed framework can improve the performance of traditional deep learning-based approaches under the three challenges.",Domain difference | fault diagnosis | limited dataset | triplet network | unbalanced dataset,0,0,,,NSFC,2020YFH0022,Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

The safety function of a PSV is to open and relieve the pressure when the equipment pressure exceeds the predefined set point. To achieve the desired availability of the PSV function, periodic function testing is regularly performed to confirm the correct functioning of a PSV. If a fault of the PSV function is detected by a function test, the PSV is repaired to a functioning state. For this reason, the interval between function tests has a direct influence on the probability of failure on demand (PFD) of the PSV function. On the other hand, unwanted leakage can occur due to human errors made during the preparation prior to a test and the reinstatement after the test. Such leakage is not desired due to the potential for being ignited and causing a major accident, but this aspect is often not considered in the availability assessment of PSVs. Therefore, this paper suggests a multi-phase Markov approach that can estimate the PFD of a PSV as well as the frequency of the leaks induced by the periodic tests. The suggested approach may be suitable for supporting the decision about the test interval for a PSV, considering both reliability and risk effect of extending the function test interval.",,1,0,,,,undefined,,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

Moreover, we consider cascading failures within and between networks. With the proposed model, we show that failures in the power network have a considerable negative impact on the railway network.

They promised more reliable equipment and a safer environment. An all-electric production system performs several functions related to hydrocarbon production control. It also performs safety functions by isolating the reservoir from the environment. Safety functions are performed by activation of safety valves. These safety valves include electric springs in their design instead of mechanical springs. Failure modes and effects analysis of these valves show that interruptions in the power supply appear as random demands to the safety valves, and experiencing such demands may deteriorate their performance. However, the current reliability assessment of safety valves does not consider any degradation phenomena. This paper's main objective is to investigate the degradation modes caused by demands and their influence on the all-electric actuation system's performance under different maintenance strategies. A degradation modeling framework based on the multiphase Markov process is proposed. The impact of demand is modeled by changing the initial condition or by increasing the transition rates between two degraded states. The amplitude of the increment depends on the condition at the time of the demand. Analytical formulae are developed for the time-dependent reliability assessment.",All-electric subsea production system | Degradation due to demands | Harmful testing | Multiphase Markov process | Safety performance assessment | Technology qualification,4,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,Norges Forskningsråd,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

This work explores on the application of a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) to encompass different modelling assumptions as non-negligible maintenance delays and inspection-based condition monitoring. These assumptions are relevant for many critical infrastructures in civil engineering or in oil & gas industry whose deterioration states are classified at a very high level of abstraction among a finite and small set of possible states.

A multistate resilience model is developed based on a Markov reward process model, where the degradation and recovery of system performance are characterized by a continuous time discrete state Markov chain and the losses caused by the extreme event is modeled by the reward rates associated with the sojourns in the degradation states and the transitions among the states.

Final elements remain dormant mostly in a low demand mode but become vulnerable due to degradation along with time. Tests and maintenances are key activities to prevent the SIS from any failures, including those thank to degradation, to activate upon demands. This paper models the degradation of SIS final elements by considering an intermediate degraded state between the working- and failed states. Sometimes, the actual system states are not distinguished perfectly during proof tests. Such imperfectness in state revealing, consequently, weakens the real performance of follow-up maintenances. The effects of imperfect degradation state revealing are quantified, together with three testing and maintenance strategies for 1-out-of-2 configured SISs. Time-dependent PFD of the system and cumulative life-cycle cost are then estimated in a finite service time.

To cope with increasing disruptive events such as man-made and natural disasters attacking infrastructures, resilience should be considered as an integrated perspective into the system planning process. This paper presents a p-robust optimization model for infrastructure network planning against spatially localized disruptions. The optimization aims at minimizing the investment costs for system hardening and expansion and the total system costs under nominal operating conditions, while incorporating resilience requirements by the p-robustness constraints. Importantly, instead of only mitigating system vulnerability, the proposed model integrates the arranging of the repair sequence of damaged components under limited repair resources into the preevent system planning. The complexity of the proposed model is analyzed, and a hybrid algorithm that combines scenario-based decomposition and variable neighborhood search is developed for its efficient solution. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through an application to a real power transmission system.

In real-life cases, considering that multiple different MSWKNS structures are provided beforehand, system designers need to select an optimal one among numbers of different structure designs. Thus, screening of the optimal MSWKNS structure is meaningful and critical. Moreover, the system reliability becomes an increasingly important factor that should be assessed in structure screening. However, when facing a large-scale MSWKNS whose number of states is enormous, exact reliability evaluation can be rather complicated. Meanwhile, due to the large number of system structure designs, the computational burden of screening can be very huge. To effectively select the optimal structure among enormous MSWKNSs under reliability constraint, an optimal structure screening method named as ordinal structure screening (OSS) is proposed. Ordinal optimization (OO) algorithm is adopted with a novel utilization of continuization discretization approximation (CDA) method. To shorten the reliability evaluation time, CDA is employed to approximate reliabilities. Based on the approximate reliabilities, OO is applied to reduce the number of system structures to be evaluated, which accelerates the screening process.

Such assessment methods suffered from a lot of limitations. For example, it is in general difficult to collect enough life testing data to support an accurate reliability assessment. Further, the experimental conditions can hardly reproduce the way a consumer will use a product in practice. In the meantime, with the expansion of the Internet, a lot of customers give their feedbacks on the products by posting reviews on websites. This constitutes a huge, easily accessible, and more realistic database that can be used to assess reliability. In this work, we scraped reviews from a famous e-commerce website. Machine learning models are developed to extract failure-related information from these reviews. Two kinds of information are examined in this study: (1) whether a review reports a failure and, in such a case, (2) the severity of the failure. We used natural language processing tools to process text and we developed different classification models for information extraction. The developed methods were tested on customer review data from 11 different tablets of several brands. The results we obtained were around 85% accuracy when training and testing our models with our dataset. Hence, the machine learning-based approach we developed is demonstrated to be a promising first step to assess reliability thanks to web-based data. However, with a corpus containing only a few thousand reviews and more than 100,000 words, using text to train classification models remains a complicated task.

The majority of European railway networks are electrified, and power transmission networks represent usually the main power supplier. Railway and power networks share thus a unidirectional interdependency, as the railway network functionality depends on the power network. Due to this interdependency, failures in power networks have the potential of causing vast disruption in the dependent railway networks. Despite this, the issue of modeling interdependent railway and power networks has not been addressed sufficiently carefully in the existing literature. Furthermore, the treatment of cascading failures in power networks and their consequences in railway networks is limited and approximative. In this work, we propose a modeling framework which accounts for more realistic assumptions on the interconnections topology and the cascading failures dynamics. Firstly, we model the interconnections between the railway and external power network by introducing the traction power network, which acts as a bridge between the external power grid and the railway network. Secondly, we model cascading failures in the external and traction power networks with an approach based on the DC power flow model. Thirdly, we suggest a simple approach to estimate the negative consequences on the railway network due to load shedding in the traction power network. Vulnerability analysis is performed to estimate the negative consequences in the railway network due to different failure scenarios in the external power network. Sensitivity analysis on the initial assumptions is also performed.",Cascading failures | Critical infrastructures | Interdependent networks | Power network | Railway network | Vulnerability,1,0,,,EDF,undefined,Electricité de France,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

Modern CIs rely on the fifth generation of mobile communication (5G) paradigm to incorporate new technologies, deliver new sophisticated services and adopt new business models. These models will shift the CI interdependencies towards a new dynamic paradigm where communication resources are deployed within the CIs operational scheme to reach performance and quality of service (QoS) objectives. Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Network Slicing (NS) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) are examples of 5G-enabling technologies used to reach the aforementioned objectives. However, due to the complex nature of CIs and the interdependencies between their components, the shift toward a dynamic operational scheme will increase the vulnerability and exposure to risks, impacting the network resilience. This requires the design of new resilience frameworks that consider the heterogeneity, privacy and self-interest nature of CIs and guarantee reliability and QoS objectives in such a constrained and dynamic environment. To tackle the resilience problem, we propose a framework to dynamically coordinate and manage the deployment of communications resources, based on NFV. This framework will ensure the availability of services, meet performance objectives during disruptive events and overcome constraints of interdependencies and heterogeneity.

However, as one of the vital part of flight efficiency, fuel consumption is easily affected by external factors induced by various uncertainties such as severe weather conditions, which impact decision making process. Therefore, a distributionally robust mixed integer programming model for ATFM problem (DR-ATFM) is introduced in this paper to handle the uncertainty of fuel consumption while minimizing the total cost of fuel consumption, flight cancellation and flight delays. By exploiting the moment information of the fuel consumption data, a moment ambiguity set is constructed which characterizes the actual distribution of fuel consumption influctation. Based on this, an equivalent reformulation of DR-ATFM is derived to transform the problem into a mathematically solvable one, which is further solved through a cutting plane-based decomposition algorithm proposed in this paper.

In this context, this paper proposes an integrated risk assessment framework for an electric power system, considering scenarios that involve the electrified transportation system enabled by EVs charging technology in New York (NY) State. Firstly, scenarios in the transportation network of NY State, e.g. of reduced capacity and incident, are generated by a Monte Carlo non-sequential algorithm. Then, the cell transmission model (CTM) is used to simulate the evolution of the traffic flows under such scenarios. This allows evaluating the spatial-temporal EV charging loads in different areas of the electrified transportation system of NY State. Correspondingly, the running parameters in the studied power system are updated by the alternative current (AC) power flow model. Finally, the risk for the power system coming from the transportation system scenarios is assessed within a probabilistic risk analysis framework. The proposed integrated risk assessment framework is able to model the propagation of the effects of scenarios in the transportation system onto the power system of NY State and quantify the consequences.

For mathematical tractability, most approaches rely either on the consideration of specific maintenance strategies, e.g. Periodic Inspection and Replacement (PIR), whose defining parameters are optimized, or on time-and-space-state discretization using Markov Decision Process (MDP) models and resolution through policy iteration. In both cases, optimality may be hard to guarantee. In this paper, the decision-theoretic concept of Value of Information (VoI) is used as a metric to guide resource prioritization in time, that is, to schedule inspections in a piecewise optimal manner. An aperiodic sequential inspection policy is proposed, where the determination of the next best time for inspection, or replacement, is based on the current condition and on the computed expected gain from possible inspections, i.e. on a VoI metric. This policy can be implemented when the current condition is known from imperfect inspection or processing of condition-monitoring data. Also, more generally, a discussion is proposed on the use of VoI as a guide for information collection in life-cycle management.",Condition-Based maintenance | Imperfect information | Inspection planning | Maintenance optimization | Renewal theory | Sequential decision-making | Value of information,37,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

Then, the confidence that can be put in its outcomes is fundamental, and this depends on the accuracy, representativeness and completeness of the models used in the risk assessment. A quantitative measure is needed to assess the credibility and trustworthiness of the outcomes obtained from such models, for decision-making purposes. This article proposes a four-level, top-down, hierarchical tree to identify the main attributes and criteria that affect the level of trustworthiness of models used in risk assessment. The level of trustworthiness (Level 1) is broken down into two attributes (Level 2), three sub-attributes and one “leaf” attribute (Level 3), and seven basic “leaf” sub-attributes (Level 4). Based on this hierarchical decomposition, a bottom-up, quantitative approach is employed for the assessment of model trustworthiness, using tangible information and data available for the basic “leaf” sub-attributes (Level 4). Analytical hierarchical process is adopted for evaluating and aggregating the sub-attributes, and Dempster–Shafer theory is adopted to consider the uncertainty and the inconsistency in the experts’ judgments. The approach is applied to a case study concerning the modeling of the residual heat removal system of a nuclear power plant, to compute its failure probability. The relative trustworthiness of two mathematical models of different complexity is evaluated: a fault tree and a multi-states physics-based model. The trustworthiness of the multi-states physics-based model is found to outweigh that of the fault tree model, which can be explained by the fact that multi-states physics-based model takes into account the components failure dependency relations and degradation effects. The feasibility and reasonableness of the approach are, thus, demonstrated, paving the way for its potential applicability to inform decision-making on safety-critical systems.",analytical hierarchical process | Dempster–Shafer theory | fault tree | model trustworthiness | multi-states physics-based model | nuclear power plant | Risk-informed decision-making,1,0,,,,undefined,,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

These safety barriers, although designed to operate in different phases of the accidents evolution, are often optimized separately, without considering their collective effects on preventing disruptions and quickly recovering from the disruptions. This paper develops a joint optimization model for synthetically optimizing safety barriers of different natures, including prevention, mitigation, emergency and recovery barriers to enhance the business continuity of the NPP, considering the threat of steam generator tube rupture (SGTR) accidents. The joint optimization is guided by a business continuity metric called expected business continuity value (EBCV). A physics-of-failure model is developed to describe the crack growth process of the steam generator tube and to model the effect of the prevention barriers, i.e., periodical inspection of the crack length. An event tree model is developed to describe the evolution of the SGTR-initiated accident and to model the effect of the mitigation and emergency barriers. Recovery measures are also considered via a widely-used logarithmic function model. A mixed-integer genetic algorithm (MIGA) is used to obtain optimal solutions of the joint optimization model. The results show that the developed joint optimization model can achieve better performance in terms of business continuity, compared to the conventional methods that optimize the safety barriers separately.",Business continuity management (BCM) | Event tree (ET) | Joint optimization | Mixed-integer genetic algorithm (MIGA) | Nuclear power plant (NPP) | Safety barrier | Steam generator tube rupture (SGTR),12,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,CSC,201506450020,China Scholarship Council,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

In the present paper, we develop an extended framework for the analysis of the criticality of assumptions in risk assessment by evaluating the risk that deviations from the assumptions lead to a reduction of the safety margins. The framework aims to support risk-informed decision making by identifying important assumptions and integrating the assessment of their criticality into the quantitative risk assessment (QRA). The framework is, finally applied within the quantitative risk assessment of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) exposed to external flooding. Compared to previous works on the subject, we consider also conservative assumptions and introduce decision flow diagrams to support the classification of the criticality of the assumptions.

The Stuxnet, which destroyed Iran's uranium enrichment facility in 2010, suggests that NPPs could even lead to an accident involving the release of radioactive materials cyber-attacks. However, cyber security research on industrial control systems (ICSs) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems is relatively inadequate compared to information technology (IT) and further it is difficult to study cyber-attack taxonomy for NPPs considering the characteristics of ICSs. The advanced research of cyber-attack taxonomy does not reflect the architectural and inherent characteristics of NPPs and lacks a systematic countermeasure strategy. Therefore, it is necessary to more systematically check the consistency of operators and regulators related to cyber security, as in regulatory guide 5.71 (RG.5.71) and regulatory standard 015 (RS.015). For this reason, this paper attempts to suggest a template for cyber-attack taxonomy based on the characteristics of NPPs and exemplifies a specific cyber-attack case in the template. In addition, this paper proposes a systematic countermeasure strategy by matching the countermeasure with critical digital assets (CDAs). The cyber-attack cases investigated using the proposed cyber-attack taxonomy can be used as data for evaluation and validation of cyber security conformance for digital devices to be applied, and as effective prevention and mitigation for cyber-attacks of NPPs.",Cyber security | Cyber-attack taxonomy | ICS | Nuclear power plant | SCADA,24,1,repositoryvor,Green,MOTIE,20171510102100,"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy",Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

In the present study, the uncertainty in the magnitude-and site-related parameters is considered in the establishment of GMPEs by ANNs. For this, an algorithm is proposed based on the generalized least-squares principle applied to ANNs training. A simulated database is used to validate the approach and to demonstrate the effect of the input parameter uncertainties on the GMPEs. Finally, the proposed model is applied to the Reference database for seismic ground motion in Europe (RESORCE) data-base.

High-speed rail is a critical infrastructure that is subject to various disruptions, including component aging, malicious attacks, natural disasters, and demand surges. In this study, we analyze the topological centrality indicators of China Railway High-speed network using network theory and take real train flow information for assessing the importance of network components in terms of vulnerability to disruption. By Monte Carlo simulation, we analyze the risk of the China Railway High-speed network under random attacks and spatially localized failures.

In this article, the model serves as the basis for an analysis aimed at determining a set of protective actions to be taken (e.g., increasing the number of monitoring devices, reducing the number of accesses to the safety-critical system) in order to effectively reduce the level of vulnerability of the safety-critical systems under consideration. In particular, the problem is here tackled within an optimization framework: the set of protective actions to implement is chosen as the one minimizing the overall level of vulnerability of a group of safety-critical systems. In this context, three different optimization approaches have been explored: (i) one single classification model is built to evaluate and minimize system vulnerability; (ii) an ensemble of compatible classification models, generated by the bootstrap method, is employed to perform a “robust” optimization, taking as reference the “worst-case” scenario over the group of models; (iii) finally, a distribution of classification models, still obtained by bootstrap, is considered to address vulnerability reduction in a “probabilistic” fashion (i.e., by minimizing the “expected” vulnerability of a fleet of systems).

Most of the existing resilience quantification methods assume that the performance level of the system is continuous. A lot of practical energy systems, however, are multistate in nature or needs to be modeled by multistate models to control the modelling/computational complexity (Levitin, 2011). There are only a few works regarding quantifying resilience using multistate models. Thekdi and Chatterjee (2019) developed a multistate hidden Markov model to quantify resilience of infrastructure systems and discussed decision making based on the model. Nuss et al. (2017) used a continuous time discrete state Markov model to quantify the resilience against disruptions considering the multistate engineering system behaviors of unmanned surface vessels to support system design selection during trade studies. In a previous research of the authors (Du et al., 2019), a Markov reward process-based model is developed for quantifying resistant, absorption, recovery and overall resilience. All the above mentioned works are based on Markov (or hidden Markov) models. A significant drawback of these Markov model-based methods is that they have to assume that the transition times among states follow exponential distributions. Practical systems, however, exhibit a variety of time-dependent behaviors, which cannot be adequately described using only exponential distributions. In this paper, we develop a Semi-Markov reward process-based approach to quantify resilience of multistate systems, considering the time-dependent behaviors of both the pre-disruption protection processes and the post-disruption recovery processes. Four numerical metrics are defined to quantify resilience based on the developed model.

Specifically, agents involved in the resilience management aim at an optimum process of sequential preparedness/protection, emergency response, recovery, and adaptation activities, trading off the loss due to lack of system functionality with the needed investment. Agents' decisions are made sequentially aiming at minimizing the overall system loss in the presence of numerous uncertainties in the intensity of the disruption, post-disruption demand, repair durations, etc. We restrict the actions to only depend on uncertain parameters realized up to the current decision period. This process can be formulated as a multi-stage optimization problem. We discuss how the linear decision rule approximation can be used to overcome the curse of the computational complexity of the problem and to derive operationally implementable policies.

In this respect, business continuity management (BCM) has been proposed as a comprehensive and proactive framework to prevent the disruptive events from impacting the business operations and reduce their potential damages. Most existing business continuity assessment (BCA) models that numerically quantify the business continuity are time-static, in the sense that the analysis done before operation is not updated to consider the aging and degradation of components and systems which influence their vulnerability and resistance to disruptive events. On the other hand, condition monitoring is more and more adopted in industry to maintain under control the state of components and systems. On this basis, in this work, a dynamic and quantitative method is proposed to integrate in BCA the information on the conditions of components and systems. Specifically, a particle filtering-based method is developed to integrate condition monitoring data on the safety barriers installed for system protection, to predict their reliability as their condition changes due to aging. An installment model and a stochastic price model are also employed to quantify the time-dependent revenues and tolerable losses from operating the system. A simulation model is developed to evaluate dynamic business continuity metrics originally introduced. A case study regarding a nuclear power plant (NPP) risk scenario is worked out to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.",Business continuity management (BCM) | Condition monitoring | Dynamic business continuity assessment (DBCA) | Event tree (ET) | Particle filtering (PF) | Prognostic and health management (PHM),11,1,repositoryam,Green,CSC,201506450020,China Scholarship Council,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

Resilience against extreme weather is also becoming an important concern. In this study, a modeling and optimization framework for power systems planning, which considers both operational flexibility and resilience against extreme weather events, is proposed. In particular, a set of piece-wise linear models are developed to capture the impact of extreme heat waves and drought events on the performance of the power generation units and on the system load. A method is, also, proposed to incorporate the impact models within a modified optimal power system planning problem that can adequately accommodate high shares of IRES. The framework is applied to a case study based on real future climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) under different levels of IRES penetration (up to 50%) and severity of the extreme weather events. A sensitivity analysis is conducted for planning under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) that cover the impact of different trajectories of greenhouse gas concentration on future climate. In particular, RCPs with increase in radiative forcing of +8.5 Wm-2, +4.5 Wm-2 and +2.6 Wm-2 of the pre-industrial levels are considered. The results demonstrate that significant improvements in terms of load supply under an extreme heat wave and drought events can be achieved following the resilient planning framework proposed, compared to conventional planning methods. It is also shown how renewable generation units can improve the system performance against those extreme climate events. Moreover, the quantitative assessment indicates an important interaction between the resilience of the system and its flexibility, and the compound impact of failing to consider either aspect in the power system design phase.",Extreme weather events | Operational flexibility | Power system design | Power system resilience | Renewable energy penetration,52,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,,Already existed in HAL!,Not existed in the stamped team!

In this framework, the potential impacts of a specific natural hazard on an infrastructure are first evaluated in terms of failure and recovery probabilities of system components. Then, these are fed into a bi-level attacker–defender interdiction model to determine the critical components whose failures lead to the largest system functionality loss. The proposed framework bridges the gap between the difficulties of accurately predicting the hazard information in classical probability-based analyses and the over conservatism of the pure attacker–defender interdiction models. Mathematically, the proposed model configures a bi-level max-min mixed integer linear programming (MILP) that is challenging to solve. For its solution, the problem is casted into an equivalent one-level MILP that can be solved by efficient global solvers. The approach is applied to a case study concerning the vulnerability identification of the georeferenced RTS24 test system under simulated wind storms.

When the fuel cell stack experiences variable operating conditions, degradation indicators, such as the stack voltage and the stack State Of Health (SOH), are not able to individually provide precise and robust RUL predictions. The stack voltage does not directly measure the component degradation, as it is only related to degradation symptoms, which are significantly affected by operating conditions. The SOH provides aging information but it can only be measured at low frequency in industrial applications. The objective of this work is to combine the two indicators, leveraging their strengths and overcoming their drawbacks. Two different physics-based models are used to this aim: the first model receives a signal directly observable and related to the stack voltage, which can be frequently and easily measured; the second model is fed by periodic measurements from the physical characterization of the stack, which gives reliable information on the SOH evolution. The prognostic procedure is implemented using Particle Filtering (PF), and the outcomes of the two prognostic filters are aggregated to obtain the ensemble predictions. The ensemble-based approach employs a local aggregation technique that combines the outcomes of two prognostic models by assigning to each model a weight and a bias correction, which are obtained considering the individual models’ local performances. The dependence between the two indicators is also accounted for, by dependent Gamma processes. The results obtained show that the accuracy of the RUL predictions obtained by the proposed ensemble-based method outperforms that obtained by the individual models.",Dependent processes | Ensemble | Particle Filtering (PF) | Prognostics | Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) | Remaining Useful Life (RUL),52,1,repositoryam,Green,,ANR-11-LABX-0001–01,,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

In fact, the uncertainties faced by restoration activities, e.g. stemming from subjective estimates of resources and costs, are rarely considered. Thus, the solutions obtained by a deterministic approach may be suboptimal or even infeasible under specific realizations of the uncertainties. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates the effects of uncertain repair time and resources on the post-disruption restoration of critical infrastructure. Two-stage stochastic optimization provides insights for prioritizing the intensity and time allocation of the repair activities with the objective of maximizing system resilience. The inherent stochasticity is represented via a set of scenarios capturing specific realizations of repair activity durations and available resources, and their probabilities. A multi-mode restoration model is proposed that offers more flexibility than its single-mode counterpart. The restoration framework is applied to the reduced British electric power system and the results demonstrate the added value of using the stochastic model as opposed to the deterministic model. Particularly, the benefits of the proposed stochastic method increase as the uncertainty associated with the restoration process grows. Finally, decision-making under uncertainty largely impacts the optimum repair modes and schedule.",Critical infrastructures | Restoration planning | Stochastic programming | System resilience | Uncertainty,87,0,repositoryam,Green,CTI,undefined,Kommission für Technologie und Innovation,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

In practice, random shock processes are often unobservable, which makes it difficult to accurately estimate the shock intensities and predict the RUL. In the proposed method, the problem is solved recursively in a two-stage framework: in the first stage, parameters related to the degradation processes are updated using particle filtering, based on the degradation data observed through condition monitoring; in the second stage, the intensities of the random shock processes are updated using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, considering the dependency between the degradation and shock processes, and the fact that no hard failure has occurred. The updated parameters are, then, used to predict the RUL of the system. Two numerical examples are considered for demonstration purposes and a real dataset from milling machines is used for application purposes.

They are inherently large- scale dynamic systems with a high degree of spatio-temporal complexity. Their reliability and security of supply are central considerations in any regional or global energy-related policy. Methods for power systems planning have typically ensured key operational reliability aspects under normal operating conditions and in response to anticipated demand variability, uncertainty and supply disruptions, e.g. due to errors in load forecasts and to unexpected generation units outages. Solutions have been commonly built on capacity adequacy and operating reserves requirements, among others. However, recent objectives for environmental sustainability and the threats of climate change are challenging the reliability requirements of power systems in various new ways and necessitate adapted planning methods. The present chapter describes some of the issues related to the development of the integrated techno-economic modeling and robust optimization framework that is needed today for power systems planning adapted. Such planning framework should cope with the new context by addressing the challenges associated with the sustainability targets of future power systems, and most notably ensuring operational flexibility against the variability of renewable energy sources, ensuring resilience against extreme weather events and ensuring robustness against the uncertainties inherent in both the electric power supply and system load. This chapter presents the context by summarizing the main sustainability drivers for the current (and future) power systems planning and operation. These well-known sustainability targets have become a worldwide imperative in all sectors of economic activity, and are embedded within almost any regulatory or policy dialogue. We will, then, review the particular transformation undergoing in the electric power sector planning, not only driven by the sustainability goals, but also by the more general technological and/or regulatory advancements.

The scheme has two main modules based on extreme learning machines: pre-processing and prediction. The pre-processing module uses novel single and multiple imputation techniques to estimate the missing observations. The prediction module aims to obtain precise predictions even in the presence of missing observations and with the related uncertainty. The pre-processing module sends imputed subsets of samples to the prediction module, which makes use of extreme learning machines for one-step and multi-steps predictions. The prediction module contains various multi-steps prediction strategies including iterative, direct and DirRec, which use the constant-current experimental capacity data for the long-term prediction of the remaining useful life. Accurate prediction of RUL requires continuity in the time-series dataset. The proposed scheme is designed to build an intelligent prediction system with the ability to handle time-series data containing missing values and is robust enough to generate a complete time-series dataset and, then, make short or long term predictions.

In this paper, the prognostics scheme is utilized to estimate the remaining useful life of a battery, with insufficient direct data available, but taking advantage of observations available from a fleet of similar batteries with similar working conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed prognostic scheme provides a fast and efficient estimation of the remaining useful life of the batteries and achieves superior results when compared with various state-of-the-art prediction techniques.",extreme learning machines | Lithium-ion batteries | multi-steps prediction | one-step prediction | Prognostics,18,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

The most promising configuration of a nuclear fusion system is currently the tokamak, the largest of which, called the largest of which (ITER), is under construction in Cadarache, France. The safety of nuclear fusion systems has to be proved and verified by a systematic analysis of the system behavior under normal transient and accidental conditions. One challenge to the analysis is that the operation of tokamaks presents complex dynamic features as it is based on the transformer principle: in particular, they employ superconducting magnets, a subset of which operates with variable current to generate one of the components of the magnetic field needed to confine the plasma in the chamber where nuclear fusion reactions occur. In the present paper, we apply techniques of Integrated Deterministic and Probabilistic Safety Assessment (IDPSA), which combine phenomenological models of system dynamics with stochastic process models, taking for the first time as reference system the cooling circuit of a superconducting magnet for fusion applications, subject to a Loss-Of-Flow-Accident (LOFA).",,1,0,,,,undefined,,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

This study provides a framework for uncertainty representation in building energy modeling, due to both random factors and imprecise knowledge. The framework is shown by a numerical case study of sizing cooling loads, in which uncertain climatic data are represented by probability distributions and human-driven activities are described by possibility distributions. Cooling loads obtained from the hybrid probabilistic-possibilistic propagation of uncertainty are compared to those obtained by pure probabilistic and pure possibilistic approaches. Results indicate that a pure possibilistic representation may not provide detailed information on the peak cooling loads, whereas a pure probabilistic approach may underestimate the effect of uncertain human behavior.

Specifically, the deep learning method is combined with the data window method and structural controllability theory to predict the conditions of gas pipeline network components. The data window method is applied to reconstruct the data structure and build a “memory” for the deep learning method. Structural controllability theory is applied to extract critical parameters, for reducing the problem size. The developed method allows accurate and efficient predictions, especially in abnormal conditions. For demonstration, the method is applied to a complex gas pipeline network. The results show that the developed method can provide accurate real-time predictions useful for reducing potential losses in operation, and perform efficient and effective management of the gas pipeline system.

The quantitative approach includes four steps, namely, accident scenario modeling by an event tree model, probability and dependence analysis of the associated intermediate events, risk assessment with respect to the consequent outcome events. A major ship accident in Arctic waters - ships stuck in ice, is chosen as a case to interpret the modeling process of the approach proposed. Crews and ships owners can use such approach to defining risk control options that enable optimal risk mitigation. Maritime management may also benefit from better risk assessment.",Accident scenario analysis | Arctic waters | Frank copula | Fuzzy-event tree analysis | Ship accidents | Ship stuck in ice,59,1,repositoryam,Green,H2020,730888,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

The framework proposed includes: (i) the formulation of an integrated generation expansion planning (GEP) and unit commitment (UC) model accounting for key short-term technical constraints, (ii) the elaboration of accurate and systematic horizon reduction methods to alleviate the computational burden of the resulting large-sized optimization problems and (iii) the definition of suitable metrics for the operational flexibility assessment of the obtained plans. The framework is applied to a ten year planning horizon of a realistically sized case study representing the national power system of France, under several scenarios of RES penetration levels and carbon limits, spanning levels of up to 50%. The importance of incorporating the detailed short-term constraints within long-term planning models is shown. The results of the assessment show that, under high renewable energy penetration, neglecting the short-term constraints may lead to plans significantly short on flexibility, reaching shortage levels of up to 50% in frequency and several GWs in magnitude. Also, the load not served reaches levels of up to 3% and carbon emission is underestimated by up to 60%. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of relying on suitable quantitative metrics for operational flexibility assessment in power systems planning rather than solely relying on generic performance measures, such as system costs and mixes of power plants, which are shown not to sufficiently reflect the flexibility levels of the obtained plans.",Flexibility metrics | Generation expansion planning | Operational flexibility | Optimization | Renewable energy penetration | Unit commitment,62,0,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

In this paper, the reverse nearest neighbors technique is adopted for detecting outliers and the k nearest neighbors technique is used to identify the borderline points for defining the classification hyperplane in support vector machines. Considering the position of each data point and the distribution of its nearest neighbors, a new method is proposed for calculating their estimation error costs.

Our study combines a synthetic power grid generator with a direct current (DC) cascading failure simulator. The impact of each of the factors and their interactions unravel useful insights for interventions aimed at reducing the probabilities of large blackouts on existing and future power systems. Moreover, conclusions drawn from a spectrum of different power grid topologies and electrical configurations offer more generality than typically attained when studying specific test cases. Line redundancy and distributed generation appear as the most efficacious parameters for reducing the probabilities of large power losses and multiple line overloads, although the effect decays with network density. Also, re-dispatch strategies are critical on the distribution of the cascading failure size in terms of line failures.

The analysis can be seen as composed of three successive steps, namely scenario generation, modeling and post-processing. Generation involves simulating an as complete and realistic as possible set of accident scenarios; modeling involves representing in a structured way the simulated scenarios; post-processing involves extracting from the simulated scenarios information relevant for the safety assessment of the system, in particular, untangling the safe scenarios from the prime implicants (PIs) (minimum combinations of failure events that are capable of leading the system into a fault state) and the near misses (NMs) (combinations of failure events that lead the system to a quasi-fault state, a condition close to accident).

On the other hand, the safe operation of NPPs has become an urgent problem that the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA) must solve. To this end, NNSA established a nationalwide OEF system to improve the safety level of NPPs and strengthen the exchange of operating experience. Analyzing the human factors events (HFEs) is an important part of OEF and it is significant to improve human performance and prevent human error. Data mining has been recognized as an effective way to analyze data. With the continuous increase in operating event reports, data mining related to nuclear safety becomes a new domain of study. In this paper, we propose a data mining framework in support of the OEF system. The framework combines three statistical approaches (i.e., correlation analysis, cluster analysis and association rule mining) for identifying intrinsic correlations among human factors: correlation analysis measures the strength of linear relationship between human factors; cluster analysis classifies human factors into relevant groups; association rule mining identifies associations and causalities among human factors. For illustration, we apply the proposed framework to 162 human factors events (screened out from 313 events collected from the OEF system), and the results reflect the feasibility and effectiveness of the framework in identifying the intrinsic correlations among human factors.

To address this issue, we develop a dynamic risk assessment (DRA) method that allows online estimation of risk indexes using data collected during operation. Two types of data are considered: statistical failure data, which refer to the counts of accidents or near misses from similar systems and condition-monitoring data, which come from online monitoring the degradation of the target system of interest. For this, a hierarchical Bayesian model is developed to compute the reliability of the safety barriers and a Bayesian updating algorithm, which integrates particle filtering (PF) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo, is developed to update the reliability evaluations based on both the statistical and condition-monitoring data. The updated safety barriers reliabilities, are, then, used in an event tree (ET) for consequence analysis and the risk indexes are updated accordingly. A case study on a high-flow safety system is conducted to demonstrate the developed methods. A comparison to the DRA method which only uses statistical failure data shows that by introducing condition-monitoring data on the system degradation process, it is possible to capture the system-specific characteristics, and, therefore, provide a more complete and accurate description of the risk of the target system.",Condition-monitoring | dynamic risk assessment (DRA) | event tree (ET) analysis | hierarchical Bayesian model | Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) | particle filtering (PF),59,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

Finally, a risk-based classification approach is performed to identify critical future temperatures, which may lead to passive containment cooling system risks beyond acceptable levels.",climate change | ensemble of climate models | nuclear power plant | passive containment cooling system | Probabilistic safety assessment | risk-based classification,3,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

Most existing CCF models assume that the component failure behavior does not vary over time. Such an assumption is often challenged in practice due to the influence of various degradation mechanisms, e.g., wear, corrosion, fatigue, etc. In this paper, we develop a new model for CCFs considering components degradation. The model is developed in the mathematical framework of Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS). The CCFs are modeled as random shock processes that affect a group of components simultaneously and the components degradation processes are modeled by stochastic differential equations derived from physics-of-failures. The benefit of using the SHS model for CCFs is that the developed model is analytically solvable. The system reliability can, then, also be solved analytically in closed form. The proposed CCF modelling framework is demonstrated by a numerical example of a three-unit redundant system and, then, applied to an Auxiliary Feedwater Pump (AFP) system of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). A comparison to the Binomial Failure Rate (BFR) model of literature shows that by considering the components degradation processes, the proposed model can accurately describe the CCF effect on the reliability of a system with degrading components.",Binomial failure rate model | Common-cause failures | Component degradation | Monte Carlo simulation | Random shocks | Stochastic hybrid systems,31,0,,,NSFC,61573043,National Natural Science Foundation of China,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

The results confirm that the adaptive simulation framework proposed is effective in identifying critical regions of operation with a limited number of calls to the computationally expensive model. The time of occurrence and magnitude of the failures of the components of the control system are identified as key factors to characterize the critical regions.

Evaluating such designs through conventional life tests is difficult as the affordable test time is too short to generate a meaningful amount of failure data. In this paper, we design and implement an accelerated life test (ALT) for evaluating the reliability of pneumatic cylinders. From a detailed analysis of failed samples from field operation, the major failure mechanisms that affect the reliability of pneumatic cylinders are identified, e.g., wear and tear of sealing rings. For these failure mechanisms, temperature and frequency are found out to be the significant stresses of the pneumatic cylinders. A two-factor-four-level full-factor design of ALT is, then, performed to set up an ALT plan for the pneumatic cylinders. A total number of 95 samples are tested according to the ALT plan, and a mixed Arrhenius-inverse-power-law model is used to fit the test data and predict the reliability under normal operation conditions. In addition, a normal stress test of eight samples is performed to validate the reliability predicted by the ALT. The results show that using the proposed ALT, the reliability of the pneumatic cylinder can be predicted with satisfactory accuracy. It is also shown that the designed ALT plan requires only 38.77% of the testing effort of other conventional life tests.",Accelerated life test | data analysis | failure mechanisms | pneumatic cylinders | reliability,8,1,repositoryam,Green,CSC,201706025028,China Scholarship Council,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

For plants exposed to multiple hazards, Multi-Hazards Risk Aggregation (MHRA) is necessary to inform decisions. In practice, this is often done by a simple arithmetic summation over the different risk contributors, without taking into account that the state of knowledge of the risk models of the different hazards can be quite different. In this paper, we provide a hierarchical framework to assess the strength of knowledge that PRA models are based upon. The framework is organized in three attributes characterizing the knowledge which a PRA model is based upon (assumptions, data, phenomenological understanding). These attributes are further broken down into sub-attributes and, finally, “leaf ” attributes that can be evaluated. The PRA models of two hazards groups for Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) are considered and the strength of knowledge behind each model is assessed using the developed framework.",,1,0,,,,undefined,,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

In this work, we present the research being performed to develop a method for efficiently measuring and locating pipelines which are critical to gas distribution. Graph theory, thermal-hydraulic simulation, optimization and network flow method are integrated to calculate the pipeline criticality with respect to the supply of gas. Graph theory is applied to model the supply-transmission-demand systems. A capacity model, superposed on the graph model, and a combination of thermal-hydraulic simulation and optimization is used to simulate the system operation under different scenarios and estimate the different supply performances of the pipelines. This allows to assess the criticality of the pipelines by the network flow method. For demonstration, the method is applied to a relatively complex gas pipeline network. The results of the application show that the method can provide analytical information useful to improve the system robustness and perform a more efficient and effective protection of the gas supply system.",,3,0,,,,undefined,,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

In the non-repairable MS-PMS, the dependence among phases are more complicated, like the components’ states cannot be better in the latter phases. The paths of the MMDD model generated by traditional MMDD manipulation rules cannot consider this kind of dependency and part of the paths may have the self-conflict problems. To solve this problem, a MMDD algorithm for MS-PMS and PMS-MMDD model are proposed. By the PMS-MMDD model, the system MMDD model can be generated without any additional steps.

These parameters are estimated with collected monitoring data. The choices of the initial value ranges and distributions of the unknown parameters in the state and observation equations influence the performance of the particle filtering approaches, in terms of convergence, speed, and stability of prognostic results. For new products with little or even no degradation process data, uniform distributions over experience-based value ranges are the most common choice for parameters initialization. In this paper, the failure times' data collected during reliability tests executed before volume production are used for defining the initial value ranges and distributions of uncertain parameters. This is expected to increase the convergence speed of the parameters estimation with monitored data and to reduce the uncertainty of the predicted remaining useful life. Numerical experiments on synthetic degradation processes of PEM fuel cells and lithium-ion batteries are considered. The convergence speed of the parameters estimation and the sensitivity of the proposed method to the duration and number of product samples in the reliability tests are analyzed. Comparisons with particle filtering methods with standard initialization are also carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed new strategy for parameters initialization.",failure times data | parameters initialization | particle filtering | Prognostics | reliability test | remaining useful life,6,1,repositoryam,Green,NSFC,61703431,National Natural Science Foundation of China,Already existed in HAL!,Already existed in the stamped team!

Epistemic uncertainty associated with component degradation processes is treated by considering interval-valued parameters. This leads to the formulation of a multi-objective optimization problem whose objectives are the lower and upper bounds of the expected maintenance cost, and whose decision variables are the periods of inspections and the thresholds for preventive maintenance.
