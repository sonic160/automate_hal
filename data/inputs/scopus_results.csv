In this type of market, dispatch infeasibilities caused by line failures are solved using a counter-trading mechanism where costs arise as a result of correcting the power dispatch. The risk index proposed takes into account these correction costs as well as the cost of the energy not served due to the failure, while considering an oligopolistic behavior of the generation companies. A 3-stage model is proposed to simulate the bidding behavior in the market, under different line failures scenarios. The risk index proposed and the method for its calculation are applied on an adapted IEEE 6-bus reliability test system. A sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the sensitivity of the results with respect to the level of competitiveness of the generation companies, measured by the conjectured-price response parameter which is assumed to be exogenous in our study. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Conjectural-variation equilibrium; Direct-current optimal power flow; Electricity market; Line failure; Risk assessment; Transmission network","Cost benefit analysis; Electric industry; Electric load dispatching; Electric load flow; Electric network analysis; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Outages; Power markets; Sensitivity analysis; Conjectural variations; Conjectural-variation equilibrium; Direct-current; Direct-current optimal power flow; Line failure; Market environment; Network failure; Optimal power flows; Risks assessments; Uniform pricing; competitiveness; electricity supply; energy market; network analysis; price dynamics; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; three-dimensional modeling; Risk assessment","","","","","","","Y.-F.

Resilience against extreme weather is also becoming an important concern. In this study, a modeling and optimization framework for power systems planning, which considers both operational flexibility and resilience against extreme weather events, is proposed. In particular, a set of piece-wise linear models are developed to capture the impact of extreme heat waves and drought events on the performance of the power generation units and on the system load. A method is, also, proposed to incorporate the impact models within a modified optimal power system planning problem that can adequately accommodate high shares of IRES. The framework is applied to a case study based on real future climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) under different levels of IRES penetration (up to 50%) and severity of the extreme weather events. A sensitivity analysis is conducted for planning under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) that cover the impact of different trajectories of greenhouse gas concentration on future climate. In particular, RCPs with increase in radiative forcing of +8.5 Wm-2, +4.5 Wm-2 and +2.6 Wm-2 of the pre-industrial levels are considered. The results demonstrate that significant improvements in terms of load supply under an extreme heat wave and drought events can be achieved following the resilient planning framework proposed, compared to conventional planning methods. It is also shown how renewable generation units can improve the system performance against those extreme climate events. Moreover, the quantitative assessment indicates an important interaction between the resilience of the system and its flexibility, and the compound impact of failing to consider either aspect in the power system design phase. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Extreme weather events; Operational flexibility; Power system design; Power system resilience; Renewable energy penetration","Atmospheric radiation; Climate models; Greenhouse gases; Sensitivity analysis; Systems analysis; Weather information services; Extreme weather events; Heatwaves; Modelling framework; Operational flexibility; Power; Power system designs; Power system resilience; Renewable energy penetrations; Renewable energy source; System resiliences; Drought","","","","","","","E.

The uncertainty of electricity demand and renewable power generation is taken into account through bounded intervals, with parameters that permit control over the level of conservatism of the solution. The multistage robust optimization model allows the sequential representation of uncertainty realization as they are revealed over time. It also guarantees the non-anticipativity of future uncertainty realizations at the time of decision-making, which is the case in practical real-world applications, as opposed to two-stage robust and stochastic models. To render the resulting multistage robust problem tractable, decision rules are employed to cast the uncertainty-based model into an equivalent mixed integer linear (MILP) problem. The re-formulated MILP problem, while tractable, is computationally prohibitive even for moderately sized systems. We, thus, propose a solution method relying on the reduction of the information basis of the decision rules employed in the model, and validate its adequacy to efficiently solve the problem. The importance of considering multistage robust frameworks for accounting for net-load uncertainties in generation expansion planning is illustrated, particularly under a high share of renewable energy penetration. A number of renewable penetration scenarios and uncertainty levels are considered for a case study covering future generation expansion planning in Europe. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in coping with multifold operational uncertainties and for deriving adequate generation investment decisions. Moreover, the quality of the solutions obtained and the computational performance of the proposed solution method is shown to be suitable for practical policy-making generation expansion planning problems, seeking to evaluate the impact of uncertainty on future system-wide performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Generation expansion planning; High renewable energy systems; Multistage adaptive robust optimization; Uncertainty treatment; Unit commitment","Europe; Decision making; Integer programming; Investments; Quality control; Regional planning; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Decision rules; Generation expansion planning; High renewable energy system; Multi-stages; Multistage adaptive robust optimization; Robust optimization; Solution methods; Uncertainty; Uncertainty treatment; Unit Commitment; alternative energy; electricity; future prospect; policy making; power generation; range expansion; Renewable energy resources","","","","","National University of Singapore, NUS, (R-266-000-070-281, WBS R-266-000-089-592); National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF","The authors would like to thank Dr. Elizaveta Kuznetsova for her feedback and support in the early stages of the work.

Critical infrastructures are often interdependent on each other, and the topology of the interdependencies between different systems, also referred to as coupling interface, plays a key role in terms of their resilience against failures. In case of failures due to natural events, random disturbances, or deliberate attacks, the design of the coupling interface is a key factor for maintaining high performance within the interdependent CIs. However, in the existing literature, the issue of the coupling interface design is often addressed through heuristics. In this work, we propose an optimization-based mathematical approach for designing coupling interfaces between interdependent critical infrastructures under random failures. The proposed approach allows designing a coupling interface that is robust against the worst realization of a set of feasible failure scenarios. Using as case study interdependent power and gas networks, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing solutions based on network metrics-based heuristics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Coupling interface; Defender–attacker–defender; Interdependent critical infrastructures; Optimization; Resilience","Critical infrastructures; Heuristic methods; Public works; Coupling interfaces; Defender–attacker–defender; Economic stability; Interdependent critical infrastructure; Key factors; Natural events; Optimisations; Random disturbances; Resilience; Socio-economics; Optimization","","","","","","","A.

The framework proposed includes: (i) the formulation of an integrated generation expansion planning (GEP) and unit commitment (UC) model accounting for key short-term technical constraints, (ii) the elaboration of accurate and systematic horizon reduction methods to alleviate the computational burden of the resulting large-sized optimization problems and (iii) the definition of suitable metrics for the operational flexibility assessment of the obtained plans. The framework is applied to a ten year planning horizon of a realistically sized case study representing the national power system of France, under several scenarios of RES penetration levels and carbon limits, spanning levels of up to 50%. The importance of incorporating the detailed short-term constraints within long-term planning models is shown. The results of the assessment show that, under high renewable energy penetration, neglecting the short-term constraints may lead to plans significantly short on flexibility, reaching shortage levels of up to 50% in frequency and several GWs in magnitude. Also, the load not served reaches levels of up to 3% and carbon emission is underestimated by up to 60%. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of relying on suitable quantitative metrics for operational flexibility assessment in power systems planning rather than solely relying on generic performance measures, such as system costs and mixes of power plants, which are shown not to sufficiently reflect the flexibility levels of the obtained plans. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Flexibility metrics; Generation expansion planning; Operational flexibility; Optimization; Renewable energy penetration; Unit commitment","France; Carbon; Electric power system planning; Flexibility metric; Generation expansion planning; Integrated frameworks; Multi-period; Operational flexibility; Optimisations; Power systems planning; Renewable energy penetrations; Renewable energy source; Unit Commitment; alternative energy; assessment method; carbon emission; conceptual framework; energy planning; integrated approach; optimization; power generation; renewable resource; Renewable energy resources","","","","","","","E.

The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies is on the rise everywhere in the space industry. AI allows the rapid analysis of millions of events and identifies a wide range of threats - from malware exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities to the identification of risky behaviours that may lead to a phishing attack or the download of malicious code. These systems learn over time, they identify new types of attacks, by analysing the behavioural history of user profiles, assets and networks and respond on time to deviations from established norms. This paper attempts to answer the question of whether or not AI can be used to prevent cyber attacks in space and explores this new avenue of AI being utilized in the space cyber security domain. This analysis covers different AI approaches and applications used in cyber security, such as Network Security, Vulnerability Management (Proactive versus Reactive), Prevention Control and Phishing Detection (detect, track, react, solve) and behavioural analytics, as well as their limitations within the space sector. Secondly, the paper discusses the potential of AI for being used to breach cyber security, particularly by introducing new attack vectors. Moreover, the paper addresses liability issues as to the use and deployment of AI-based space applications, in particular, concerning cyber security breaches. Finally, this work attempts to highlight the best practices of AI for cyber security in space, discuss a preliminary technical and legal roadmap, take into account the different levels of cyber vulnerability of AI, and discuss short-term and long-term strategies for preventing cyberattacks on AI assets in space.

AI has already come into extensive use in spacecraft operations, for example to support efficient operations of satellite constellations and system health management. However, since most critical infrastructures rely on space systems, the use of new technologies, such as AI algorithms or increased system autonomy on-board, introduces further vulnerabilities on the system level. As a matter of fact, AI cyber security is becoming an important aspect to ensure space safety and operational security. Apart from identifying new vulnerabilities that AI systems may introduce to space assets, this paper seeks for safety guidelines and technical standardisations developed for terrestrial applications that can be applicable to AI systems in space. Existing policy guidance for cybersecurity and AI, especially for the European context, is discussed. To promote the safe use of AI technologies in space this work underlines the urgency for policymakers, governance, and technical institutions to initiate or further support the development of a suitable framework to address the new cyber-vulnerabilities introduced by AI technologies when applied to space systems. The paper suggests a regulatory approach based on technical standardisation in the field of AI, which is built upon a multidisciplinary research of AI applications in non-space sectors where the level of autonomy is more advanced. © 2023 International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety","Artificial intelligence; Cyber-vulnerabilities; Safety policy; Space applications; Technical standards","","","","","","","","P.

The neural engine can be trained on the Copernicus data from the Sentinel constellation, which includes information such as ice thickness, iceberg distribution, wind speed direction, and wave height for a specific passage. In the event of a satellite signal loss, the AI Pilot reuses the information received from Galileo up to that point and integrates them with the vessel's own maritime sensors to maintain the viability of the projected route. The idea behind the AI Pilot is that when a vessel is within communication range with other North Star vessels, they form an ad-hoc mesh network of data collectors with edge computing capabilities. The creation of a mesh network can provide augmented data to the entire GNSS ecosystem. While shipping transportation of oil and gas across the Arctic passages undergoes more strict regulations, private tourism and charter yacht operators in the Arctic are an emerging market due to the relatively unsafe travel conditions. North Star can have a beneficial impact on the tourist sector in the first place, extending afterwards to support Search and Rescue operations, as well as contributing to the protection of the environment and the Arctic fauna. This research presents the concept of operations of North Star, as well as its high-level description from the technical perspective. The potential of this business case is further investigated, to include a roadmap of services offered until the return of investment, potential customers, and current competitors.

This necessitates the development of lunar infrastructure up to this task. This contribution presents a framework for rapid, cost-efficient, and supporting construction of a permanent and modular lunar base within the scope of what will be technically and legally feasible today. The proposed concept uses the SpaceX Starship Human Landing System as the foundation for a lunar base. The Starship will be placed horizontally on the lunar surface and transformed into a habitable volume. A workforce of modular rovers will aid astronauts in the construction process, and an array of countermeasures are presented to protect the astronauts from the effects of exposure to radiation, lunar dust, and extended hypogravity. Psychological and psychosocial factors are included to enhance individual well-being and crew dynamics. Physical and cognitive workloads are defined and evaluated to identify effective countermeasures, including specific spacesuit requirements. The proposed construction activities are to be organized as a multi-national public-private partnership to establish an international authority, a concept that has been successful on Earth but has yet to be applied to space activities on a multi-national level. A roadmap incorporating each part of the construction from human and technical perspectives is outlined. Other aspects that are critical to mission success include the cultural significance of the project, legal aspects, budget, financing, and potential future uses of the base. These solutions rely mainly on existing technologies and limited modifications to the lunar lander vehicle, making it a viable solution for the construction of a lunar base in the near future. © 2021 International Astronautical Federation, IAF.

Recently, AI has come into extensive use in spacecraft operations, for example to support highly efficient operations of satellite constellations. This ranges in applications from relative positioning, Earth Observation, autonomous navigation, and end-of-life management, among others. While the importance of AI is rising for new space assets, AI is vulnerable to cyber threats, and AI cyber security is becoming an important aspect of space safety and operational security. This work aims to identify the vulnerabilities that AI systems may introduce to space assets and to analyse the potential operational threats and effective technological and regulatory mitigation measures. Towards this goal, the paper first examines and differentiates between vulnerabilities in legacy space systems, and those that are particularly related to AI technologies. The analysis covers the definition of AI technology as well as a detailed discussion about its current use in space related applications. Secondly, a comparison between prevailing cyber-attacks in space and cyber-attacks targeting AI technologies is made. Based on this assessment, the paper recommends prevention and mitigation measures that are contingent on cyber resilience of space operations focusing on AI-based space applications.

CIs are often interconnected to, and interdependent on, each other through complex coupling interfaces. Failures can propagate among different CIs through these coupling interfaces, causing multi-sectoral disruption. The design of the coupling interface can strongly impact the cascading effect between different CIs. In this paper, we propose a data-driven distributionally robust approach for the optimal coupling of interdependent CIs. Our model obtains an optimal coupling interface that maximizes the expected combined performance of interdependent CIs under random failure scenarios with ambiguous probability distributions. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach using an ambiguity set built upon a synthetic data set of historical contingency scenarios. Interdependent power and gas networks (IPGNs) are used as an illustrative case study. We show that our proposed approach leads to better coupling interfaces with higher expected performance under disruptive scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Coupling interface; Distributionally robust optimization; Interdependent critical infrastructures; Random failures; Risk analysis","Critical infrastructures; Failure (mechanical); Optimization; Probability distributions; Public works; Risk assessment; Coupling interfaces; Data driven; Distributionally robust optimization; Energy systems; Interdependent critical infrastructure; Performance; Random failures; Robust approaches; Robust optimization; Transportation network; Risk analysis","","","","","","","A.

Countries have shown different preparedness levels for promptly implementing disease detection strategies, via mass testing and isolation of identified cases, which led to a largely varying impact of the outbreak on the populations and health-care systems. In this paper, we propose a new pandemic resource allocation model for allocating limited disease detection and control resources, in particular testing capacities, in order to limit the spread of a pandemic. The proposed model is a novel epidemiological compartmental model formulated as a non-linear programming model that is suitable to address the inherent non-linearity of an infectious disease progression within the population. A number of novel features are implemented in the model to take into account important disease characteristics, such as asymptomatic infection and the distinct risk levels of infection within different segments of the population. Moreover, a method is proposed to estimate the vulnerability level of the different communities impacted by the pandemic and to explicitly consider equity in the resource allocation problem. The model is validated against real data for a case study of COVID-19 outbreak in France and our results provide various insights on the optimal testing intervention time and level, and the impact of the optimal allocation of testing resources on the spread of the disease among regions. The results confirm the significance of the proposed modeling framework for informing policymakers on the best preparedness strategies against future infectious disease outbreaks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","(S) decision support systems; COVID-19; Disaster preparedness; Non-linear programming; Pandemic control","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Disaster prevention; Disease control; Diseases; Resource allocation; SARS; (S) decision support system; Control strategies; COVID-19; Detection and controls; Disaster preparedness; Disease detection; Non-linear programming; Optimization models; Pandemic control; Testing strategies; Nonlinear programming","","","","","","","A.F.

This may bring new stresses and risks to such a system of systems. This paper presents a mathematical framework to analyze the resilience of an electrified road network (ERN) subject to potential failures of its supporting fast-charging stations (FCSs). Within this framework, a novel linear optimization model is proposed for the first time to solve the system optimal dynamic traffic assignment problem of ERN. The characteristics considered in the modeling framework include the location, capacity, and charging speed of FCSs, as well as the driving range, charging time, and state of charge (SoC) of EVs. The linear model is proposed based on the cell transmission model. It is used as the first-stage model to assign the traffic under normal FCS operations. A second-stage model is, then, extended to minimize the total travel time after the stochastic occurrence of FCS failures, that is, in the failure and recovery phases. Two metrics are considered to quantify the ERN performance and the impacts of FCS failures. A numerical example is studied to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework for analyzing ERN resilience. The results show that deploying FCSs near the highway entrances and maintaining their operation are relevant factors to enhance the system's resilience. The analysis can provide guidelines to the system operators for effective management of the ERN operation and identify resilience-critical FCSs for system resilience improvement. © 2021 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering","","Battery management systems; Combinatorial optimization; Fast charging (Batteries); Linear programming; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Stages; Stochastic systems; System of systems; Traffic control; Travel time; Cell transmission model; Effective management; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Failure and recoveries; Fast charging stations; Linear optimization model; Mathematical frameworks; Transportation system; conceptual framework; electric vehicle; numerical model; stochasticity; transportation system; Stochastic models","","","","","Department of Energy of Politecnico di Milano; Department of Excellence, (2018‐2022); MUR; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201606990003)","The participation of Hongping Wang to this research is supported by China Scholarship Council (No. 201606990003).
