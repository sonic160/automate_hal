The smart distribution grid (SDG) is thereby at the core of proposed system enhancements, due to its high fragility as well as being the interface to most newly intro-duced grid applications (distributed energy resources, electrical vehicles, industrial Internet-of- Things, etc.). The SDG can be characterized by the type of lines composing the feeders (over-head and/or underground) and deployed intelligent electronic devices (IED) that allow efficient monitoring, protection, and control of the system. This paper proposes an optimization formulation to enhance the resilience of overhead and underground networks, while considering the coupling between power grid operation and the communicating remote-controlled switches (RCS). Novel radiality constraints are introduced to guarantee the tree structure during operation. Results from testing the model in a real network show the validity of proposed radiality constraints and quantify the gap in terms of achieved resilience between full overhead and hybrid overhead-underground networks.  © 2023 IEEE.","Communication; Optimization; Overhead and Under-ground Networks; Radiality; Resilience; Smart Grid","Electric power distribution; Electric power system control; Electric power system protection; Energy resources; Overhead lines; Remote control; Trees (mathematics); Ground networks; Modeling and optimization; Optimisations; Overhead and under-ground network; Radiality; Resilience; Restoration model; Smart distribution grids; Smart grid; Underground networks; Smart power grids","","","","","","","Trpovski A., Hamacher T., A Comparative Analysis of Transmission System Planning for Overhead and Underground Power Systems using AC and DC Power Flow, 2019 Ieee Pes Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT-Europe)., (2019); Fenrick S.A., Getachew L., Cost and reliability comparisons of underground and overhead power lines, Utilities Policy, (2012); Reichl J., Et al., The importance of incorporating reliability of supply criteria in a regulatory system of electricity distribution: An empirical analysis for Austria, Energy Policy, (2008); Celli G., Et al., Meshed vs. Radial MV distribution network in presence of large amount of DG, Ieee Pes Power Systems Conference and Exposition, 2004., (2004); Cao W., Et al., Operating principle of Soft Open Points for electrical distribution network operation, App. En., (2016); Lavorato M., Et al., Imposing Radiality Constraints in Distribution System Optimization Problems, Ieee Trans.

We develop a model that considers the ages and residual values of the non-failed components and component failure time distributions. We also consider the structural and economical dependency between the items by favoring grouped over individual replacement to reduce operation costs. We use a genetic algorithm to derive the optimal opportunistic maintenance plan by minimizing the long-run operational cost considering both maintenance cost and potential penalty costs due to failure in the future. The model recommends additional preventive operations in cases where the reliability does not satisfy the quality condition and to reduce the long-run operational cost. A sensitivity analysis shows that the optimal decision is mainly affected by the logistic cost, the interest rate, and the planning horizon. The model’s performance has been evaluated using several real case problems, demonstrating that the proposed method is very efficient. © 2023 by SCITEPRESS–Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Economic Dependence; Multi-Component Systems; Opportunistic Maintenance; Reliability; Structure","","","","","","SNCF; Orange; Université Paris-Saclay; Electricité de France, EDF","The research of Zhiguo Zeng is partially financially supported by ANR under grant number ANR-22-CE10-0004 and the chaire of Risk and Resilience of Complex Systems (Chaire EDF, Orange and SNCF).

However, this also makes the demand-response programs vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this paper, we study cyber attacks that target customers’ demand-response programs in smart grids by injecting false consumption and generation information. Then, as a countermeasure, an online detector based on convolutional neural networks is designed to detect the cyber attacks and mitigate impacts. The vulnerability of power distribution systems with and without the proposed detector is analyzed with reference to a case study concerning the IEEE 34 bus test feeder. The results show that the power distribution systems is vulnerable to the studied cyber attack and the proposed detector can achieve high accuracy and mitigate the impact of cyber attacks with fixed change rates, whereas the attacks with variable change rates are inherently challenging to detect. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Convolutional neural network; Cyber attacks detector; Demand-response; Distributed renewable energy resources; Smart grids","Computer crime; Convolution; Crime; Cyber attacks; Electric power distribution; Network security; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Convolutional neural network; Cybe attack detector; Cyber-attacks; Demand response; Demand response programs; Distributed renewable energy resources; Power-distribution system; Renewable energy integrations; Smart grid; Vulnerability analysis; Smart power grids","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201700810141); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB2601605)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [grant number 2021YFB2601605 ] and China Scholarship Council [grant number 201700810141 ].

Final elements remain dormant mostly in a low demand mode but become vulnerable due to degradation along with time. Tests and maintenances are key activities to prevent the SIS from any failures, including those thank to degradation, to activate upon demands. This paper models the degradation of SIS final elements by considering an intermediate degraded state between the working- and failed states. Sometimes, the actual system states are not distinguished perfectly during proof tests. Such imperfectness in state revealing, consequently, weakens the real performance of follow-up maintenances. The effects of imperfect degradation state revealing are quantified, together with three testing and maintenance strategies for 1-out-of-2 configured SISs. Time-dependent PFD of the system and cumulative life-cycle cost are then estimated in a finite service time. Numerical examples under proposed strategies are presented to provide clues in selection of optimal testing and maintenance strategies for 1oo2 final element in SISs. © 2020 The Authors","Degrading final element; Imperfect state revealing; performance analysis; Safety-instrumented system; Testing and maintenance strategy","Life cycle; Maintenance; Degradation state; Final elements; Lifecycle costs; Optimal testing; Safety functions; Safety instrumented systems; Testing and maintenance; Time dependent; Surveying instruments","","","","","Norges Forskningsråd, (309628)","The research is supported by Norwegian Research Council under Grant No. 309628 .

Numerical indexes of functional reliability are estimated from laboratory test data or field failure data. Theses indexes are not always available to the customers. On the other hand, reliability reputation, which concerns the opinions of the general public regarding the functional performance of a given product, is dominant in affecting the purchase willingness of the customers. In this paper, we develop a new method for evaluating the reliability reputation of a given product. Numerical metrics are first defined to measure reliability reputation. Online customer's reviews are collected and used as data for reliability reputation assessment. Text mining algorithms are used to extract information regarding the reliability of the product and the maintenance service of the company. Finally, an integrated approach is proposed to evaluate the reliability reputation. A case study is conducted to demonstrate the validity of the developed methods.

Andersens veg 5, Valgrinda, Trondheim, Norway","Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) assure safety of equipment/process by performing the safety functions in demand situations. In low-demand mode of operation, final elements of SIS mostly remain idle and safety performance is measured by probability of failure on demand on average (PFDavg). In this mode, SIS are not continuously monitored but subjected to periodic tests (namely proof tests) to ascertain availability for demand situations. Sometimes, proof tests don't reveal all undetected dangerous failures and may even deteriorate mechanical components by introducing additional stress. To model such degradation phenomena, we propose a framework (based on multiphase Markov process) by adding discrete degraded states between the working and the failed states. The impact of tests is modelled by increasing the transition rates between degraded states. The amplitude increase depends on the current system state at testing time. Then, analytical formulas are developed for the evaluation of the time-dependent PFD under various maintenance policies. Later, a case study on Down hole safety valves (DHSV) is presented to find an optimum test frequency. The optimization problem arises due to the following trade-off: high frequency testing will ensure high availability of DHSV for demand situation, but the stress generated will accelerate degradation to resultant failure. © 2019 The Authors","Harm full tests; Hidden degradation; Imperfect testing; Multi-phase Markov process; Performance analysis; SIS Under degradation","Economic and social effects; Maintenance; Markov processes; Safety valves; Analytical formulas; Full tests; Mechanical components; Modelling framework; Optimization problems; Performance analysis; Probability of failure on demand; Safety instrumented systems; Surveying instruments","","","","","the Research Council of Norway","This paper has been written under the Norwegian Centre for Research based Innovation on Subsea Production and Processing (SUBPRO).

Traditional PF is a recursive Bayesian filtering framework that updates the posterior probability density function of RULs when new observation data become available. In engineering practice, due to the limited accuracy of monitoring/inspection techniques, the observation data available for PF are inevitably imprecise and often need to be treated as interval data. In this article, a novel Interval Particle Filtering (IPF) approach is proposed to effectively leverage such interval-valued observations for RUL prediction. The IPF is built on three pillars: (i) an interval contractor that mitigates the error explosion problem when the epistemic uncertainty in the interval-valued observation data is propagated; (ii) an interval intersection method for constructing the likelihood function based on the interval observation data; and (iii) an interval kernel smoothing algorithm for estimating the unknown parameters in the IPF. The developed methods are applied on the interval-valued capacity data of batteries and fatigue crack growth data of railroad tracks. The results demonstrate that the developed methods could improve the performance of RUL predictions based on interval observation data. © Copyright © 2022 “IISE”.","epistemic uncertainty; imprecise observation;

However, most studies focus on point RUL prognostics, with limited insights into the uncertainty associated with these estimates. This limits the applicability of such RUL prognostics to maintenance planning, which is per definition a stochastic problem. In this paper, we therefore develop probabilistic RUL prognostics using Convolutional Neural Networks. These prognostics are further integrated into maintenance planning, both for single and multiple components. We illustrate our approach for aircraft turbofan engines. The results show that the optimal replacement time for the engines is close to the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval of the RUL estimates. We also show that our proposed maintenance approach leads to a cost reduction of 53% compared to a traditional Time-based maintenance strategy. Moreover, compared with the ideal case when the true RUL is known in advance (perfect RUL prognostics), our approach leads to a limited number of failures. Overall, this paper proposes an end-to-end framework for data-driven predictive maintenance for multiple components, and showcases the potential benefits of data-driven predictive maintenance on cost and reliability. © 2023 The Author(s)","Aircraft;

These safety barriers, although designed to operate in different phases of the accidents evolution, are often optimized separately, without considering their collective effects on preventing disruptions and quickly recovering from the disruptions. This paper develops a joint optimization model for synthetically optimizing safety barriers of different natures, including prevention, mitigation, emergency and recovery barriers to enhance the business continuity of the NPP, considering the threat of steam generator tube rupture (SGTR) accidents. The joint optimization is guided by a business continuity metric called expected business continuity value (EBCV). A physics-of-failure model is developed to describe the crack growth process of the steam generator tube and to model the effect of the prevention barriers, i.e., periodical inspection of the crack length. An event tree model is developed to describe the evolution of the SGTR-initiated accident and to model the effect of the mitigation and emergency barriers. Recovery measures are also considered via a widely-used logarithmic function model. A mixed-integer genetic algorithm (MIGA) is used to obtain optimal solutions of the joint optimization model. The results show that the developed joint optimization model can achieve better performance in terms of business continuity, compared to the conventional methods that optimize the safety barriers separately. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Business continuity management (BCM);

Modern CIs rely on the fifth generation of mobile communication (5G) paradigm to incorporate new technologies, deliver new sophisticated services and adopt new business models. These models will shift the CI interdependencies towards a new dynamic paradigm where communication resources are deployed within the CIs operational scheme to reach performance and quality of service (QoS) objectives. Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Network Slicing (NS) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) are examples of 5G-enabling technologies used to reach the aforementioned objectives. However, due to the complex nature of CIs and the interdependencies between their components, the shift toward a dynamic operational scheme will increase the vulnerability and exposure to risks, impacting the network resilience. This requires the design of new resilience frameworks that consider the heterogeneity, privacy and self-interest nature of CIs and guarantee reliability and QoS objectives in such a constrained and dynamic environment. To tackle the resilience problem, we propose a framework to dynamically coordinate and manage the deployment of communications resources, based on NFV. This framework will ensure the availability of services, meet performance objectives during disruptive events and overcome constraints of interdependencies and heterogeneity. To illustrate our approach, we formulate the case of maintenance operations as a disruptive event in ICT hosting SG services. © ESREL 2021.

With the digital transformation, all industry sectors will develop new applications with new requirements regarding telecommunication networks that 5G should be able to meet. To meet the requirement of future 5G use cases and applications, it is crucial to study the complexity of such network system by distinguishing different parts, layers, components as well as their interdependencies. This paper describes the 5G networks from an End-to-End perspective (device, radio network, core network, data network) and from a multi-layer perspective (orchestration, virtualisation/containerization and infrastructure) to show how this system (or system of systems) is complex, especially when we address resilience challenges. Resilience requirements and challenges are further explained by proposing relevant scenarios and use cases. In this paper, we mainly intend to highlight 5G network complexity and open a discussion on methodologies to model such complex network for its resilience study with the hope that this paper could inspire the future study of researchers in the related field. © ESREL 2021.

To cope with increasing disruptive events such as man-made and natural disasters attacking infrastructures, resilience should be considered as an integrated perspective into the system planning process. This paper presents a p-robust optimization model for infrastructure network planning against spatially localized disruptions. The optimization aims at minimizing the investment costs for system hardening and expansion and the total system costs under nominal operating conditions, while incorporating resilience requirements by the p-robustness constraints. Importantly, instead of only mitigating system vulnerability, the proposed model integrates the arranging of the repair sequence of damaged components under limited repair resources into the preevent system planning. The complexity of the proposed model is analyzed, and a hybrid algorithm that combines scenario-based decomposition and variable neighborhood search is developed for its efficient solution. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through an application to a real power transmission system. Quantitative analysis can assist managers in decision making regarding investing in different system protection actions and making a tradeoff between desired resilience and budget constraints.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Critical infrastructures (CIs); disruption risk; optimization; system planning; system resilience","Analytical models; Budget control; Critical infrastructures; Decision making; Disasters; Electric power transmission; Fault tolerance; Maintainability; Optimization; Planning; Public works; Repair; Uncertainty analysis; Infrastructure networks; Real power transmission systems; Resilience; Robust optimization models; System planning; System resiliences; System vulnerability; Variable neighborhood search; Investments","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71301123, 71673210, 71725007, 71871171); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","Manuscript received May 19, 2018; revised September 26, 2018 and January 28, 2019; accepted February 26, 2019.

Specifically, agents involved in the resilience management aim at an optimum process of sequential preparedness/protection, emergency response, recovery, and adaptation activities, trading off the loss due to lack of system functionality with the needed investment. Agents' decisions are made sequentially aiming at minimizing the overall system loss in the presence of numerous uncertainties in the intensity of the disruption, post-disruption demand, repair durations, etc. We restrict the actions to only depend on uncertain parameters realized up to the current decision period. This process can be formulated as a multi-stage optimization problem. We discuss how the linear decision rule approximation can be used to overcome the curse of the computational complexity of the problem and to derive operationally implementable policies. By referring to a simple example of a notional infrastructure, we demonstrate that the proposed approach helps providing a holistic view of resilience management and deriving optimal actions and policies for resilience enhancement.

Three types of epistemic uncertainty, that is, completeness, structural and parametric uncertainties, are considered. A maturity model is developed to evaluate the management of these epistemic uncertainties in the model building process. The impact of epistemic uncertainty on the result of the risk assessment is, then, estimated based on the developed maturity model. Then, an integrated risk index is defined to reflect the epistemic uncertainty in the risk assessment results. An indifference method is developed to evaluate the index based on the maturity of epistemic uncertainty management. A case study concerning a nuclear power plant is shown to demonstrate the applicability of the overall modelling framework. © IMechE 2020.","aleatory uncertainty; epistemic uncertainty; indifference method;

In practice, the behaviors of the systems affected by these extreme events are often modeled by multistate models to facilitate the analysis. In this paper, we develop a generic framework for resilience modeling and analysis of multistate energy systems. A multistate resilience model is developed based on a Markov reward process model, where the degradation and recovery of system performance are characterized by a continuous time discrete state Markov chain and the losses caused by the extreme event is modeled by the reward rates associated with the sojourns in the degradation states and the transitions among the states. Four numerical metrics are defined to describe different aspects of system resilience, i.e. the resistant, absorption, recovery and overall resilience. A simulation-based algorithm is proposed for resilience analysis of multistate energy systems. The developed methods are applied for resilience modeling and analysis of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) under the threat of earthquakes. The Markov reward process model is developed following a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, a fragility analysis and an event tree modeling of accident evolutions. Both a time-static and time-dependent resilience analysis are conducted and the results show that the developed model is able to comprehensively describe the resilience of multistate energy systems under the threats of extreme events. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Accumulated reward; Energy system; Extreme events; Markov reward model; Multistate system; Resilience","Continuous time systems; Earthquakes; Markov chains; Nuclear fuels; Event tree modeling; Fragility analysis; Generic frameworks; Markov reward process; Markov reward process model; Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis; Simulation-based algorithms; System resiliences; Nuclear power plants","","","","","High-end Foreign Experts Recruitment Program of Shanghai university; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71601010, 71901138)","Funding text 1: This work was finished during Dr. Shijia Du’s visit to Université Paris-Saclay.

CIs are often interconnected to, and interdependent on, each other through complex coupling interfaces. Failures can propagate among different CIs through these coupling interfaces, causing multi-sectoral disruption. The design of the coupling interface can strongly impact the cascading effect between different CIs. In this paper, we propose a data-driven distributionally robust approach for the optimal coupling of interdependent CIs. Our model obtains an optimal coupling interface that maximizes the expected combined performance of interdependent CIs under random failure scenarios with ambiguous probability distributions. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach using an ambiguity set built upon a synthetic data set of historical contingency scenarios. Interdependent power and gas networks (IPGNs) are used as an illustrative case study. We show that our proposed approach leads to better coupling interfaces with higher expected performance under disruptive scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Coupling interface; Distributionally robust optimization;

However, when elicited, expert knowledge is often imprecise with large uncertainty. Moreover, as experts usually own different expertise and knowledge, the elicited knowledge from different experts might be conflicting. In this article, a two-stage optimization model is put forth to fuse the imprecise and conflicting information from multiple sources to assess reliability of multistate systems. The degradation of the components in the multistate system is modeled via imprecise Markov models. Then, in the first-stage optimization, upper and lower bounds of the degradation model parameters are determined by minimizing the conflict between the prediction of the model and the multisource imprecise information elicited from experts. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is tailored to solve the computational problems brought by the presence of high-dimensional decision variables and resolve the optimization problem. The second-stage optimization is, then, conducted to identify the upper and lower bounds of the system reliability function given that the degradation model parameters are constrained in the bounds obtained from the first-stage optimization. A numerical example, along with a radar display and control system, is used to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Multisource imprecise information; multistate system (MSS); reliability assessment; two-stage optimization","Constrained optimization; Markov processes; Numerical methods; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radar displays; Bayes method; Imprecise information; Multi-Sources; Multi-state system; Multisource imprecise information; Multistate system; Optimisations; Reliability assessments; Two stage optimizations; Uncertainty; Upper Bound; Reliability analysis","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71771039, 71922006)","This work was support by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71922006 and Grant 71771039.","Zio E., Reliability engineering: Old problems and new challenges, Rel.

This article devotes to addressing the preparedness planning problem of interdependent infrastructure networks. The interdependency between infrastructure networks is characterized by a two-way physical interdependency, that is, the state of one infrastructure network is dependent on that of another infrastructure network, and vice versa. Furthermore, the multistate characteristics of infrastructure networks are taken into account and accommodated to the studied physical interdependency. A tailored two-stage stochastic programming framework, which is able to cope with the uncertainty associated with disruption scenarios, is put forth to facilitate an effective resilience enhancement strategy under a limited budget. In this framework, the first-stage problem selects the optimal protection levels of network components in advance, whereas the second-stage problem optimizes the network operation after a disruption scenario occurs. The proposed framework is implemented to an illustrative system composed of interdependent power-water distribution networks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the resilience enhancement strategy.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Interdependent infrastructure networks; multistate network; resilience; two-stage stochastic programming; vulnerability","Budget control; Network security; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Water distribution systems; Infrastructure networks; Interdependent infrastructure network; Interdependent infrastructures; Multistate networks; Optimisations; Programming; Resilience; Two-stage stochastic programming; Uncertainty; Vulnerability; Random processes","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71771039, 71922006); National Numerical Wind Tunnel Project of China, (NNW2020ZT7-B32)","This work was supported in part by the National Numerical Wind Tunnel Project under Grant NNW2020ZT7-B32, and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71922006 and Grant 71771039","Fang Y.P., Sansavini G., Zio E., An optimization-based framework for the identification of vulnerabilities in electric power grids exposed to natural hazards, Risk Anal, 39, 9, pp. 1949-1969, (2019); Chen X., Xi Z., Jing P., A unified framework for evaluating supply chain reliability and resilience, IEEE Trans.

However, the increasing degree of interconnection between these two critical infrastructures makes it necessary to consider the multiple interdependencies when conducting vulnerability assessments. We propose an approach for the modeling and vulnerability analysis of interdependent railway and power networks which accounts for a realistic coupling through the traction power network, which acts as an interface. Moreover, we consider cascading failures within and between networks. With the proposed model, we show that failures in the power network have a considerable negative impact on the railway network. In addition, our analysis shows that the dependency of the railway network on the power network can considerably impact vulnerability and cascading failures dynamics of the power network. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cascading failures;

In real-life cases, considering that multiple different MSWKNS structures are provided beforehand, system designers need to select an optimal one among numbers of different structure designs. Thus, screening of the optimal MSWKNS structure is meaningful and critical. Moreover, the system reliability becomes an increasingly important factor that should be assessed in structure screening. However, when facing a large-scale MSWKNS whose number of states is enormous, exact reliability evaluation can be rather complicated. Meanwhile, due to the large number of system structure designs, the computational burden of screening can be very huge. To effectively select the optimal structure among enormous MSWKNSs under reliability constraint, an optimal structure screening method named as ordinal structure screening (OSS) is proposed. Ordinal optimization (OO) algorithm is adopted with a novel utilization of continuization discretization approximation (CDA) method. To shorten the reliability evaluation time, CDA is employed to approximate reliabilities. Based on the approximate reliabilities, OO is applied to reduce the number of system structures to be evaluated, which accelerates the screening process. Illustrative results show that the proposed method appeals in improving computational efficiency with satisfactory accuracy performance. © 2020","continuization; Discretization approximation; Multi-state weighted k-out-of-n system; Ordinal Optimization; Structure screening","Approximation algorithms; Computational efficiency; Reliability; Scales (weighing instruments); Structured programming; Computational burden; Different structure; Optimal structures; Ordinal optimization; Reliability constraints; Reliability Evaluation; System reliability; Weighted k-out-of-n system; Structural optimization","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51537010, 71871200)","This work was supported partly by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant #71871200 and #51537010 ).

To achieve a rational result, experts from different areas should be involved, and the uncertainties in their assessments should be properly addressed. Such information is often referred to as multisource imprecise information (MSII) and might contain high degree of conflicts, as different experts usually have different expertise and knowledge. Properly quantifying the conflicts among the MSII, then, becomes a critical issue, as the subsequent processing of MSII (e.g., combination and calibration), depends on the degree of conflict in the MSII. To this end, a new conflict measure is put forth based on the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) to quantify and visualize the conflict in the MSII from a group of experts. In the first place, the MSII from each expert is used to construct the basic belief assignment (BBA) of the reliability estimates for the corresponding expert under the DST. A 2-D conflict measure, which combines the conflict factor and Jousselme distance in DST, is, then, proposed to measure the conflict between the experts' BBAs. The conflict is quantified from two perspectives, viz., mutual conflict and total conflict. Finally, a Bhattacharyya distance-based method is developed to further quantify the informativeness of each expert's MSII to the system reliability estimate. A numerical example along with an engineering case is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Bhattacharyya distance; conflict measure; Dempster-Shafer theory; multisource imprecise information (MSII); multistate system (MSS)","Probabilistic logics; Reliability theory; Bhattacharyya distance; Conflict measure; Dempster-Shafer theory; Imprecise information; Multi-Sources; Multi-state system; Multisource imprecise information; Multistate system; Reliability assessments; System reliability; Reliability analysis","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71771039, 71922006)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Contact 71922006 and Contract 71771039.","Liu Y., Zhang B., Jiang T., Xiahou T., Optimization of multilevel inspection strategy for nonrepairable multistate systems, Ieee Trans.

However, as one of the vital part of flight efficiency, fuel consumption is easily affected by external factors induced by various uncertainties such as severe weather conditions, which impact decision making process. Therefore, a distributionally robust mixed integer programming model for ATFM problem (DR-ATFM) is introduced in this paper to handle the uncertainty of fuel consumption while minimizing the total cost of fuel consumption, flight cancellation and flight delays. By exploiting the moment information of the fuel consumption data, a moment ambiguity set is constructed which characterizes the actual distribution of fuel consumption influctation. Based on this, an equivalent reformulation of DR-ATFM is derived to transform the problem into a mathematically solvable one, which is further solved through a cutting plane-based decomposition algorithm proposed in this paper. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the method are verified based on computational results of small-sized instances.  © 2021 IEEE.","ATFM; cutting plane-based decomposition; distributionally robust optimization; uncertainty","Air transportation; Aviation; Decision making; Efficiency; Fuels; Integer programming; Air safety; Air traffic flow management; Cutting plane-based decomposition; Cutting planes; Distributionally robust optimization; Management IS; Robust optimization; Robust optimization models; Safety and efficiencies; Uncertainty; Air traffic control","","","","","","","Annual Network Operations Report, (2019); Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Airline Service Quality Performance, (2020); Bulletin on the Development of the Civil Aviation Industry in 2019; Bertsimas D., Lulli G., Odoni A., An integer optimization approach to large-scale air traffic flow management[j], Operations Research, 59, 1, pp. 211-227, (2011); Diao X., Chen C.H., A sequence model for air traffic flow management rerouting problem[j], Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 110, pp. 15-30, (2018); Yu K., Kang N., Cai K., Et al., Analysis and modeling of air traffic trajectories uncertainty in Chinese airspace[c], 2020 AIAA/IEEE 39th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC).

A hierarchical framework is first developed to conceptually represent the SoK in terms of three attributes (assumptions, data, phenomenological understanding), which are further broken down in sub-attributes and “leaf” attributes to facilitate their assessment in practice. The hierarchical framework, is, then, quantified in a top-down, bottom-up fashion for assessing the SoK. In the top-down phase, a reduced-order risk model is constructed to limit the complexity and number of basic elements considered in the SoK assessment. In the bottom-up phase, the SoK of each basic element in the reduced-order risk model is assessed based on predefined scoring guidelines and, then, aggregated using a weighted average of “leaf” attributes, where the weights are determined based on the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). The strength of knowledge of the basic events is in turn, aggregated using a weighted average to obtain the SoK for the whole risk assessment model. The developed methods are applied to a real-world case study, where the SoK of the Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) models of a Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) is assessed for two hazards groups, i.e., external flooding and internal events. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Event Tree (ET); Multi-Hazards Risk Aggregation (MHRA); Nuclear Power Plant (NPP); Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA); Risk-Informed Decision Making (RIDM); Strength of Knowledge (SoK)","Decision making; Hazards; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Statistical methods; Event trees; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Risk aggregations; Risk-informed decision making; Strength of Knowledge (SoK); article; decision making; flooding; nuclear power plant; plant leaf; practice guideline; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; Risk assessment","","","","","","","Abrahamsen H.B., Abrahamsen E.B., Hoyland S., On the need for revising healthcare failure mode and effect analysis for assessing potential for patient harm in healthcare processes, Reliab.

The evidential expectation-maximization algorithm is implemented in the offline phase to train the MoG-EHMM based on historical data. In the online phase, the trained model is used to recursively update the health state and reliability of a particular individual system. The predicted RUL is, then, represented in the form of its probability mass function. A numerical metric is defined based on the Bhattacharyya distance to measure the RUL prediction accuracy of the developed methods. We applied the developed methods on a simulation experiment and a real-world dataset from a bearing degradation test. The results demonstrate that despite imprecisions in expert knowledge, the performance of RUL prediction can be substantially improved by fusing expert knowledge with condition monitoring information.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Belief function theory; expert knowledge; mixture of Gaussians-evidential hidden Markov model (MoG-EHMM); remaining useful life (RUL)","Forecasting; Hidden Markov models; Image segmentation; Maximum principle; Numerical methods; Statistical tests; Uncertainty analysis; Belief function theory; Bhattacharyya distance; Expectation-maximization algorithms; Individual systems; Mixture of Gaussians; Monitoring information; Probability mass function; Remaining useful life predictions; Condition monitoring","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71771039, 71922006, TII-20-1970)","Manuscript received April 17, 2020; accepted May 14, 2020.

The majority of European railway networks are electrified, and power transmission networks represent usually the main power supplier. Railway and power networks share thus a unidirectional interdependency, as the railway network functionality depends on the power network. Due to this interdependency, failures in power networks have the potential of causing vast disruption in the dependent railway networks. Despite this, the issue of modeling interdependent railway and power networks has not been addressed sufficiently carefully in the existing literature. Furthermore, the treatment of cascading failures in power networks and their consequences in railway networks is limited and approximative. In this work, we propose a modeling framework which accounts for more realistic assumptions on the interconnections topology and the cascading failures dynamics. Firstly, we model the interconnections between the railway and external power network by introducing the traction power network, which acts as a bridge between the external power grid and the railway network. Secondly, we model cascading failures in the external and traction power networks with an approach based on the DC power flow model. Thirdly, we suggest a simple approach to estimate the negative consequences on the railway network due to load shedding in the traction power network. Vulnerability analysis is performed to estimate the negative consequences in the railway network due to different failure scenarios in the external power network. Sensitivity analysis on the initial assumptions is also performed. © ESREL 2021.

They promised more reliable equipment and a safer environment. An all-electric production system performs several functions related to hydrocarbon production control. It also performs safety functions by isolating the reservoir from the environment. Safety functions are performed by activation of safety valves. These safety valves include electric springs in their design instead of mechanical springs. Failure modes and effects analysis of these valves show that interruptions in the power supply appear as random demands to the safety valves, and experiencing such demands may deteriorate their performance. However, the current reliability assessment of safety valves does not consider any degradation phenomena. This paper's main objective is to investigate the degradation modes caused by demands and their influence on the all-electric actuation system's performance under different maintenance strategies. A degradation modeling framework based on the multiphase Markov process is proposed. The impact of demand is modeled by changing the initial condition or by increasing the transition rates between two degraded states. The amplitude of the increment depends on the condition at the time of the demand. Analytical formulae are developed for the time-dependent reliability assessment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","All-electric subsea production system; Degradation due to demands; Harmful testing; Multiphase Markov process; Safety performance assessment; Technology qualification","Electric power systems; Hydraulic machinery; Reliability analysis; Safety engineering; Safety testing; Safety valves; All-electric subseum production system; Degradation due to demand; Degradation modeling; Harmful testing; Multiphase markov process; Reliability assessments; Safety functions; Safety performance assessment; Subsea technology; Technology qualification; Markov processes","","","","","Norwegian Centre for Research-based Innovation on Subsea Production and Processing; SUBPRO; Norges Forskningsråd","Funding text 1: This paper has been written under the Norwegian Centre for Research-based Innovation on Subsea Production and Processing (SUBPRO) .

The safety function of a PSV is to open and relieve the pressure when the equipment pressure exceeds the predefined set point. To achieve the desired availability of the PSV function, periodic function testing is regularly performed to confirm the correct functioning of a PSV. If a fault of the PSV function is detected by a function test, the PSV is repaired to a functioning state. For this reason, the interval between function tests has a direct influence on the probability of failure on demand (PFD) of the PSV function. On the other hand, unwanted leakage can occur due to human errors made during the preparation prior to a test and the reinstatement after the test. Such leakage is not desired due to the potential for being ignited and causing a major accident, but this aspect is often not considered in the availability assessment of PSVs. Therefore, this paper suggests a multi-phase Markov approach that can estimate the PFD of a PSV as well as the frequency of the leaks induced by the periodic tests. The suggested approach may be suitable for supporting the decision about the test interval for a PSV, considering both reliability and risk effect of extending the function test interval. © 2022 Italian Association of Chemical Engineering - AIDIC.

Condition-based maintenance (CBM) leverages the current degradation condition of the studied object to optimize future maintenance interventions. CBM optimization problems are complex for multi-component systems, facing the issue of the curse of dimensionality brought by the increase in the number of components. Reinforcement learning provides a promising perspective to overcome the issue. In this paper, we studied CBM optimization for a multi-component system in which the components degrade subject to the gamma process independently. We considered multiple maintenance choices for individual components, leading to a large combinatorial action space. In this case, traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms like DQN may struggle to face the inefficiency of exploration. Instead, we propose exploiting Branching Dueling Q-network (BDQ), which incorporates the action branching architecture into DQN to drastically decrease the number of estimated actions. We trained a learning agent to minimize the expected cost for a long time horizon by taking maintenance actions according to the observed exact degrading signal for each component. We compared the policy learned by the agent with some other pre-defined static policies. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the learning algorithm and its potential for application in systems with more complex structures. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Branching Dueling Q-Network; Condition-based maintenance; Deep Reinforcement learning; Optimal maintenance planning","Complex networks; Condition based maintenance; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Action spaces; Branching dueling Q-network; Condition based maintenance; Deep reinforcement learning; Maintenance optimization; Maintenance planning; Multicomponents systems; Optimal maintenance; Optimal maintenance planning; Reinforcement learnings; Reinforcement learning","","","","","","","Peng Y., Dong M., Zuo M.J., Current status of machine prognostics in condition-based maintenance: a review, Int.

Unlike most existing works assuming the independence between different failure mechanisms, this study considers a two-fold stochastic dependence between the degradation process and the shock arrival process. First, the evolutions of the two processes depend on the changing environment; secondly, shocks may trigger the system failure or increase the degradation level alternatively. The degradation is generally described by a monotone Stochastic process. Upon periodical inspection, the system is preventively replaced whenever its degradation level exceeds a pre-determined threshold or failure occurs. Under this policy, the reliability measures, the maintenance costs in the short-run and long-run, and the optimization of the maintenance cost with respect to the decision parameters: the preventive maintenance threshold and the inspection period are investigated. Theoretical results are presented and numerical examples are given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model. © 2020","Availability; Condition-based maintenance; Degradation modelling; Dynamic environment; Reliability","Failure (mechanical); Random processes; Reliability analysis; Stochastic systems; Changing environment; Decision parameters; Degradation process; Dynamic environments; Maintenance analysis; Periodical inspection; Reliability measure; Stochastic dependence; Maintenance","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61827901, 71901026); State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, SASTIND, (JSZL2016601B003)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant numbers 61827901 , 71901026 ; and the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense under grant number JSZL2016601B003 .

In this context, this paper proposes an integrated risk assessment framework for an electric power system, considering scenarios that involve the electrified transportation system enabled by EVs charging technology in New York (NY) State. Firstly, scenarios in the transportation network of NY State, e.g. of reduced capacity and incident, are generated by a Monte Carlo non-sequential algorithm. Then, the cell transmission model (CTM) is used to simulate the evolution of the traffic flows under such scenarios. This allows evaluating the spatial-temporal EV charging loads in different areas of the electrified transportation system of NY State. Correspondingly, the running parameters in the studied power system are updated by the alternative current (AC) power flow model. Finally, the risk for the power system coming from the transportation system scenarios is assessed within a probabilistic risk analysis framework. The proposed integrated risk assessment framework is able to model the propagation of the effects of scenarios in the transportation system onto the power system of NY State and quantify the consequences. A real test case is used to illustrate the proposed framework. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Cell transmission model; electric power system; electric vehicles; integrated system; risk assessment; system of systems; traffic congestion; transportation system","Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Traffic congestion; Alternative current; Cell transmission model; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electrical power system; Probabilistic risk analysis; Sequential algorithm; Transportation network; Transportation system; Risk assessment","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201606990003)","Manuscript received March 2, 2019; revised July 17, 2019 and September 4, 2019; accepted November 18, 2019.

An efficient scheduling of maintenance tasks is key for ensuring high availability of the system and avoiding production losses and high costs from over expending. The demand of natural gas is highly dependent on weather and seasonal conditions, being higher during winter and lower during summer. Thus, the operation of the compressor stations alternates between periods of full capacity and periods of reduced capacity. The optimal planning of maintenance tasks needs to take into account such constraints from the production plans. Currently, preventive maintenance tasks are usually carried out periodically, following a calendar-based strategy. This maintenance strategy can be improved by moving to predictive maintenance in which the decisions are based on prognostics that consider both the deterioration of the system and the production profile. This work explores on the application of Piecewise-deterministic Markov Process (PDMP) as a framework for the optimization problem. The system level model captures the deterioration process of the units, the condition monitoring techniques, maintenance strategies and production profile in order to assess the performance of a maintenance strategy.

In real-life cases, engineers need to design an optimal MSSPS structure by combining different versions and number of redundant components. The objective of the design is to ensure reliability requirements using the least costs, which could be formulated as a redundancy optimization problem under reliability constraints. The genetic algorithm is one of the most frequently used method for solving redundancy optimization problems. In traditional genetic algorithms, the population size needs to be determined based on the experience of the modeler. Often, this ends up creating a large number of unnecessary samples. As a result, the computational burden can be huge, especially for large-scale MSSPS structures. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an optimal structure designing method named as redundancy ordinal optimization. The universal generating function technique is applied to evaluate the reliabilities of the MSSPSs. Based on the reliabilities, an ordinal optimization algorithm is adapted to update the parent populations and the stopping criterion of genetic algorithm, so that the unnecessary structure designs can be eliminated.

Therefore, it is important that the power system resilience be improved by implementing new technology and utilizing optimization methods. This paper proposes a data-driven spatial distributionally robust optimization (DS-DRO) model to provide an optimal plan to install and dispatch distributed energy resources (DERs) against the uncertain impact of natural hazards such as typhoons. We adopt an accurate spatial model to evaluate the failure probability with regard to system components based on wind speed. We construct a moment-based ambiguity set of the failure distribution based on historical typhoon data. A two-stage DS-DRO model is then formulated to obtain an optimal resilience enhancement strategy. We employ the combination of dual reformulation and a column-and-constraints generation algorithm, and showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach with a modified IEEE 13-node reliability test system projected in the Hong Kong region. © 2022 Society for Risk Analysis.","distributed energy resources; distributionally robust optimization; power grids; resilience analytics; typhoon hazards","China; Hong Kong; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Hurricanes; Optimization; Outages; Wind; Damage failures; Data driven; Distributed Energy Resources; Distributionally robust optimization; Natural hazard; Power grids; Resilience analytic; Robust optimization; Robust optimization models; Typhoon hazard; energy efficiency; energy resource; natural hazard; numerical model; optimization; power generation; smart grid; spatial distribution; typhoon; algorithm; article; energy resource; Hong Kong; hurricane; probability; reliability; wind speed; Hazards","","","","","InnoHK; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71971181, 72032005, 72171191); Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (11200621, 11203519); Innovation and Technology Commission - Hong Kong; Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province, (2021JM‐026)","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (72171191, 71971181 and 72032005) and by Research Grant Council of Hong Kong (11203519, 11200621).

Simplest structure of a SIS consists of a sensor to detect anomaly of a given process parameter, a logic solver to decide appropriate actions given the nature of detected anomaly and a final element to execute necessary actions to prevent an imminent failure. As a critical safety barrier, unavailability assessment of SIS receives a great deal of attention and its safety requirement is regulated mainly by IEC 61508 standard. It demands a systematic and quantitative evaluations of SIS unavailability by some suggested methods such as Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD), Markov Chains, Petri Nets, etc. which must then be compliant with the SIL (Safety Integrity Level) required for that particular application. In general, quantification of SIS unavailability adopts a convenient assumption that failure rates of the SIS elements are constant over the operational lifetime. Although such an assumption is usually justified for sensor and logic solver subsystems of a SIS, it may not be equally valid for final elements. These final elements are often located and operated in harsh environment-making them subject to degradation. Furthermore partial tests and proof tests for maintenance purpose are believed to have some negative impact on the condition of the final element. Several challenges exist when considering time-dependent failure in unavailability quantification, for instance, difficulties in detecting failures due to passive nature of low demand SISs, lack of relevant data for parameter estimation when modeling with stochastic processes, imperfectness of tests, non-periodicity in testing practice, etc. In this paper, a multiphase Markov model is proposed to model a SIS final element subject to both partial and full proof test by considering the negative impact due to tests, non-detection and non-negligible repair time. The analytical model is validated by Monte Carlo simulation and the impact of negative tests and non-detection is discussed in the light of sensitivity analysis. Finally, number of partial tests over a given mission time is optimized to show the trade off between PFDavg and number of tests. © 2019 European Safety and Reliability Association.

Traditional deep learning methods face three major challenges, i.e., when the training dataset is limited, unbalanced, and/or when the model is applied in the different working conditions from the training dataset. In this article, we propose an improved deep learning-based fault diagnosis framework for EMAs based on triplet network with coupled cluster losses. Unlike the traditional approaches, the proposed framework learns to predict similarity between samples, rather than the fault labels directly. The trained model is used to calculate the distance between testing samples and a set of benchmark samples with known labels. Fault diagnosis is, then, conducted based on the $K$-nearest neighbor algorithm. Experiments on a real-world EMA dataset from NASA show that the developed framework can improve the performance of traditional deep learning-based approaches under the three challenges. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Domain difference; fault diagnosis; limited dataset; triplet network; unbalanced dataset","Deep learning; Electromechanical actuators; Electromechanical devices; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Mechanical actuators; NASA; Nearest neighbor search; Numerical methods; Deep learning; Domain differences; Employee welfare; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Limited dataset; Transfer learning; Triplet network; Unbalanced datasets; Personnel training","","","","","Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program, (2020YFH0022); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075349); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202106240078)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 52075349, in part by the Sichuan Science and Technology Program under Grant 2020YFH0022, and in part by the China Scholarship Council under Grant 202106240078.","Azam M., Et al., Prognostics and health management (phm) of electromechanical actuation (ema) systems for next-generation aircraft, Proc.

Such assessment methods suffered from a lot of limitations. For example, it is in general difficult to collect enough life testing data to support an accurate reliability assessment. Further, the experimental conditions can hardly reproduce the way a consumer will use a product in practice. In the meantime, with the expansion of the Internet, a lot of customers give their feedbacks on the products by posting reviews on websites. This constitutes a huge, easily accessible, and more realistic database that can be used to assess reliability. In this work, we scraped reviews from a famous e-commerce website. Machine learning models are developed to extract failure-related information from these reviews. Two kinds of information are examined in this study: (1) whether a review reports a failure and, in such a case, (2) the severity of the failure. We used natural language processing tools to process text and we developed different classification models for information extraction. The developed methods were tested on customer review data from 11 different tablets of several brands. The results we obtained were around 85% accuracy when training and testing our models with our dataset. Hence, the machine learning-based approach we developed is demonstrated to be a promising first step to assess reliability thanks to web-based data. However, with a corpus containing only a few thousand reviews and more than 100,000 words, using text to train classification models remains a complicated task. Especially, the models developed in this paper strongly overfit despite the use of several methods designed to prevent overfitting. © ESREL 2021.

However, there is still a need for reducing unnecessary inspections and/or preventive maintenance actions and their associated cost, through optimal design of condition-based maintenance (CBM) strategies. Accordingly, mathematical modelling and optimization of CBM has become of interest for industry managers and researchers. This work explores on the application of a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) to encompass different modelling assumptions as non-negligible maintenance delays and inspection-based condition monitoring. These assumptions are relevant for many critical infrastructures in civil engineering or in oil & gas industry whose deterioration states are classified at a very high level of abstraction among a finite and small set of possible states. A formalism to model this type of problems is proposed in which the deterministic motion of the PDMP is reduced to a trivial differential equation to track the time elapsed between events. A numerical scheme for quantification, as an approximation of the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation, is presented. Later, an illustration case dealing with CBM of road bridges by the NPRA (Norwegian Public Roads Administration) is presented, guiding through the modelling and quantification approach. © 2021","Condition-based maintenance; Monte Carlo simulation; Numerical analysis; Piecewise deterministic Markov process; Road bridges maintenance; Stochastic modelling","Computational complexity; Condition monitoring; Critical infrastructures; Deterioration; Differential equations; Highway bridges; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Preventive maintenance; Roads and streets; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Condition; Condition based maintenance; Discrete state; Maintenance Action; Maintenance models; Model application; Monte Carlo's simulation; Piecewise deterministic Markov process; Road bridge maintenance; Stochastic-modeling; Markov processes","","","","","Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet, NTNU","The authors would like to thank the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the E39 Coastal Highway Route project for their contribution to the problem statement, granting access to their database and their involvement and discussions with experts.

To achieve better performance, telecommunication networks adopt technologies such as NFV (Network Function Virtualization). However, this evolution also brings more potential risks to the telecommunication network. Reliability and resilience are becoming critical for service delivery in the networks. To answer to service requirements of high level availability and reliability, a model with a global view of infrastructure, virtual network elements, and network layer structure is required. Toward this end, this paper presents a Petri Net method to model 5G and beyond telecommunication networks. We introduce an extended Petri Net to model physical infrastructure, virtual infrastructure, network services, their behaviors, and dependencies. We present a simulation result on network availability estimation. This result shows the potential of the Petri Net-based model to be applied to a complex telecommunication system resilience assessment.  © 2022 IEEE.","5G networks; availability; B5G; modeling; Petri Net; resilience; simulation","Availability; Complex networks; Network function virtualization; Network layers; Petri nets; Queueing networks; B5G; Complex applications; Modeling; Network resilience; Performance; Potential risks; Resilience; Service delivery; Simulation; Telecommunications networks; 5G mobile communication systems","","","","","","","Banchs A., Gutierrez-Estevez D.M., Fuentes M., Boldi M., Provvedi S., A 5G mobile network architecture to support vertical industries, IEEE Communications Magazine, 57, 12, pp. 38-44, (2019); Li R., Decocq B., Barros A., Fang Y., Zeng Z., Complexity in 5G Network Applications and use cases, 31st European Safety and Reliability Conference, 2021, pp. 3054-3061; Sayrac B., 5G Common Terminology, 5G Smart Manufacturing, (2020); ResiliNets Wiki; Hobler T., Scheuvens L., Franchi N., Simsek M., Fettweis G.P., Applying reliability theory for future wireless communication networks, IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC, 2017, pp. 1-7, (2017); Sayad K., Lemoine B., Barros A., Fang Y., Zeng Z., Dynamic orchestration of communication resources deployment for resilient coordination in critical infrastructures network, 31st European Safety and Reliability Conference, 2021, pp. 2055-2062; Harutyunyan D., Shahriar N., Boutaba R., Riggio R., Latency-Aware Service Function Chain Placement in 5G Mobile Networks, IEEE Conference on Network Softwarization, 2019, pp. 133-141, (2019); Qu L., Assi C., Shaban K., Khabbaz M.J., A reliability-Aware network service chain provisioning with delay guarantees in NFVenabled enterprise datacenter networks, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 14, 3, pp. 554-568, (2017); Carlinet Y., Perrot N., Alves-Tzitas A., Minimum-cost virtual network function resilience, INOC, pp. 37-42, (2019); Di Mauro M., Galatro G., Longo M., Postiglione F., Tambasco M., Comparative performability assessment of SFCs: The case of containerized IP multimedia subsystem, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 18, 1, pp. 258-272; Mosahebfard M., Vardakas J., Verikoukis C., Modelling the admission ratio in NFV-based converged optical-wireless 5G networks, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 70, 11, pp. 12024-12038, (2021); Farooq H., Parwez M.S., Imran A., Continuous time Markov chain based reliability analysis for future cellular networks, Proc IEEE Glob.

Paris-Saclay, CentraleSuplec, LGI, EA 2606, France","We develop in this paper a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model for a maintenance planning problem and solve it with an efficient point-based value iteration (PBVI) algorithm. We consider a single-unit system, subjected to random degradation and failures, and for which the current degradation state can be partially observed via an imperfect monitoring system. The system state space is finite, and we model the following maintenance operations: i) perfect inspection, ii) preventive maintenance and iii) corrective maintenance. The goal is to optimize the maintenance policy by taking into account the imperfect monitoring data in order to minimize the expected discounted maintenance cost over an infinite time horizon. We formulate the problem as a POMDP where, at each time step, it should be decided whether or not to conduct a maintenance operation, and if so, which one. To keep the model general and flexible, we suppose that monitoring data are collected every K time steps (i.e. one observation epoch). The model is completed by a constraint imposing that only one maintenance operation can be conducted per observation epoch. Eventually, we solve it using a PBVI algorithm. The value function is approximated by interpolation of grid data points, and new relevant points are dynamically added into the grid where they most improve the value function. This approach is compared to a POMDP modeling based on approximate sample paths (ASP); when evaluated in different cost scenarios, the proposed approach systematically finds better maintenance policies for a comparable computation time. The computation of a lower bound finally proves that we are able to get the optimal value of the problem with satisfying precision.

Most of the existing resilience quantification methods assume that the performance level of the system is continuous. A lot of practical energy systems, however, are multistate in nature or needs to be modeled by multistate models to control the modelling/computational complexity (Levitin, 2011). There are only a few works regarding quantifying resilience using multistate models. Thekdi and Chatterjee (2019) developed a multistate hidden Markov model to quantify resilience of infrastructure systems and discussed decision making based on the model. Nuss et al. (2017) used a continuous time discrete state Markov model to quantify the resilience against disruptions considering the multistate engineering system behaviors of unmanned surface vessels to support system design selection during trade studies. In a previous research of the authors (Du et al., 2019), a Markov reward process-based model is developed for quantifying resistant, absorption, recovery and overall resilience. All the above mentioned works are based on Markov (or hidden Markov) models. A significant drawback of these Markov model-based methods is that they have to assume that the transition times among states follow exponential distributions. Practical systems, however, exhibit a variety of time-dependent behaviors, which cannot be adequately described using only exponential distributions. In this paper, we develop a Semi-Markov reward process-based approach to quantify resilience of multistate systems, considering the time-dependent behaviors of both the pre-disruption protection processes and the post-disruption recovery processes. Four numerical metrics are defined to quantify resilience based on the developed model. The model is applied to analyze the resilience of a crude oil storage tank farm. © ESREL2020-PSAM15 Organizers.

This work proposes a resilience enhancement framework for ICIs. With reference to the accidental event, ex-ante and ex-post solutions for enhancing system resilience are analysed and included into a hierarchical model of resilience enhancement strategies (RES). To provide specific resilience enhancement solutions for ICIs, we integrate the hierarchical model with a model predictive control-based dynamic model of ICI system operation. The relationships between the solutions implemented and their impacts on the system parameters are discussed. A multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem is defined, with the objectives of simultaneously minimizing RES cost and maximizing ICIs resilience. The fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm NSGA-II is used to solve the MOO problem. For exemplification, a case study is considered, involving interdependent natural gas network and electric power grid. The results show that the resilience enhancement framework is effective in finding optimal RESs for given ICIs. © 2021","Control-based dynamic model; Critical infrastructure; Multi-objective optimization; Resilience","Critical infrastructures; Dynamic models; Electric power transmission networks; Genetic algorithms; Hierarchical systems; Model predictive control; Public works; Risk assessment; Accidental event; Control-based dynamic model; Critical infrastructure; Enhancement framework; Hierarchical modeling; Multi-objectives optimization; Multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs); Resilience; Risks assessments; Safety management; Multiobjective optimization","","","","","","","Hosseini S., Barker K., Ramirez-Marquez J.E., A review of definitions and measures of system resilience, Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 145, pp. 47-61, (2016); Barker K., Lambert J.H., Zobel C.W., Tapia A.H., Ramirez-Marquez J.E., Albert L., Et al., Defining resilience analytics for interdependent cyber-physical-social networks, Sustain Resilient Infrastruct, 2, pp. 59-67, (2017); Ramirez-Marquez J.E., Rocco C.M., Barker K., Moronta J., Reliab Eng Syst Saf, (2017); Fang Y.-P., Pedroni N., Zio E., Resilience-Based Component Importance Measures for Critical Infrastructure Network Systems, IEEE Trans Reliab, 65, pp. 502-512, (2016); Park J., Seager T.P., Rao P.S.C., Convertino M., Linkov I., Integrating risk and resilience approaches to catastrophe management in engineering systems, Risk Anal, 33, pp. 356-367, (2013); Henry D., Ramirez-Marquez J.E., Generic metrics and quantitative approaches for system resilience as a function of time, Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 99, pp. 114-122, (2012); Holling C.S., Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems, Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 4, pp. 1-23, (1973); (2015); Francis R., Bekera B., A metric and frameworks for resilience analysis of engineered and infrastructure systems, Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 121, pp. 90-103, (2014); Ellis J., Fisher D., Longstaff T., Pesante L., Pethia R., Miller T.R., Et al., (1997); Zio E., (2016); Rinaldi S.M., Peerenboom J.P., Kelly T.K., Identifying, understanding, and analyzing critical infrastructure interdependencies, IEEE Control Syst Mag, 21, pp. 11-25, (2001); Buldyrev S.V., Parshani R., Paul G., Stanley H.E., Havlin S., Catastrophic cascade of failures in interdependent networks, Nature, 464, pp. 1025-1028, (2010); Fang Y., Zio E.; Ouyang M., Review on modeling and simulation of interdependent critical infrastructure systems, Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 121, pp. 43-60, (2014); Patelli E., Tolo S., George-Williams H., Sadeghi J., Rocchetta R., de Angelis M., Et al., OpenCossan 2.0: an efficient computational toolbox for risk, reliability and resilience analysis, (2018); Turnquist M., Vugrin E., Design for resilience in infrastructure distribution networks, Environmentalist, 33, pp. 104-120, (2013); Croope S., McNeil S., Improving Resilience of Critical Infrastructure Systems Post Disaster Recovery and Mitigation, Transp Res Rec J Transp Res Board, (2011); Godschalk D.R., Urban Hazard Mitigation: Creating Resilient Cities, Nat Hazards Rev, 4, pp. 136-143, (2003); Adie C.E., Holistic disaster recovery: Ideas for building local sustainability after a natural disaster, (2001); Ouyang M., Duenas-Osorio L., Min X., A three-stage resilience analysis framework for urban infrastructure systems, Struct Saf, 36-37, pp. 23-31, (2012); Uday P., Marais K., Designing Resilient Systems-of-Systems: A Survey of Metrics, Methods, and Challenges.

In this context, a suitable use for the generated CO2 is its reinjection into the reservoir, and subsea CO2 separation improves the efficiency of this process. The main objective of this work is to investigate the health-aware control of a subsea CO2 separation system. Previously identified linear models were used in a predictive controller with Kalman filter-based state estimation and online model update, and simulations were performed to evaluate the controller tuning. Regarding prognostics, a stochastic model of pump degradation, sensitive to its operating conditions, was proposed, and a particle filter was implemented to perform online degradation state estimation and remaining useful lifetime prediction. Finally, a health-aware controller was designed, which could extend the life of the process by four months when compared to operation with a conventional model predictive controller. Some difficulties in combining reference tracking and lifetime extension objectives were also investigated. The obtained results indicate that dealing with the control problem through the multiobjective optimization theory or addressing the lifetime extension in an optimization layer may improve its performance. © 2020 by the authors.","Equipment reliability; Predictive control; Remaining useful lifetime; Statistic inference; Subsea processing","","","","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Norges Forskningsråd","This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior-Brasil (CAPES)-Finance Code 001 and by the Norwegian Research Council through the INTPART programme.","Rausand M., Hoyland A., System Reliability Theory: Models, Statistical Methods, And Applications;, 396, (2004); Heng A., Zhang S., Tan A.C., Mathew J., Rotating machinery prognostics: State of the art, challenges and opportunities, Mech.

When developing data-driven fault diagnosis models for EMA, training and testing data might come from different working conditions, reducing the generalization ability of traditional data-driven models. To address the challenge of domain difference between training and testing data, we propose a hybrid domain adaptation network, whose loss functions comprise of adversarial loss, triplet loss and cross-entropy loss. Adversarial loss and triplet loss can enhance the inter-domain and intra-class domain clustering, respectively. A softmax classifier with cross-entropy loss is used to predict pseudo labels for unlabeled target domain training samples. Compared to traditional transfer learning models that only reduces the global inter-domain difference between two domains, the strength of our model is that both the intra and inter-class domain difference are reduced. Curriculum pseudo labeling (CPL) is further applied to dynamically adjust thresholds for different classes during training phases. Compared to the fixed threshold in previous efforts, CPL can take into account the difference in pseudo label prediction and improve the performance of the developed model. The experiment results show that, compared to several transfer learning models, the developed model can achieve better classification accuracy in target domain. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Curriculum pseudo labeling; EMA fault diagnosis; Hybrid domain adaptation; Inter-domain clustering; Intra-class domain clustering","Ability testing; Electromechanical actuators; Electromechanical devices; Entropy; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Learning systems; Mechanical actuators; Actuator fault; Clusterings; Curriculum pseudo labeling; Domain adaptation; Electro-mechanical actuator fault diagnose; Faults diagnosis; Hybrid domain; Hybrid domain adaptation; Inter-domain; Inter-domain clustering; Intra class; Intra-class domain clustering; Labelings; Curricula","","","","","SNCF; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075349); Orange; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202106240078); Aeronautical Science Foundation of China, (201905019001); Electricité de France, EDF","The research of Anne Barros and Zhiguo Zeng are partially supported by the chaire of Risk and Resilience of Complex Systems (Chaire EDF, Orange and SNCF).

Most of the previous prediction works consider the single-airport scenario, which overlooks the time-varying spatial interactions hidden in airport networks. In this paper, the flight delay prediction problem is investigated from a network perspective (i.e., multi-airport scenario). To model the time-evolving and periodic graph-structured information in the airport network, a flight delay prediction approach based on the graph convolutional neural network (GCN) is developed in this paper. More specifically, regarding that GCN cannot take both delay time-series and time-evolving graph structures as inputs, a temporal convolutional block based on the Markov property is employed to mine the time-varying patterns of flight delays through a sequence of graph snapshots. Moreover, considering that unknown occasional air routes under emergency may result in incomplete graph-structured inputs for GCN, an adaptive graph convolutional block is embedded into the proposed method to expose spatial interactions hidden in airport networks. Through extensive experiments, it has been shown that the proposed approach outperforms benchmark methods with a satisfying accuracy improvement at the cost of acceptable execution time. The obtained results reveal that deep learning approach based on graph-structured inputs have great potentials in the flight delay prediction problem. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Flight delay prediction; graph convolutional neural network; graph-structured information; time-evolving airport network","Air traffic control; Air transportation; Convolution; Deep learning; Forecasting; Graph neural networks; Airport network; Convolutional neural network; Flight delays predictions; Graph convolutional neural network; Graph-structured information; Learning approach; Spatial interaction; Structured information; Time evolving graphs; Time-evolving airport network; Graphic methods","","","","","","","Rebollo J.J., Balakrishnan H., Characterization and prediction of air traffic delays, Transp.

High impact low probability (HILP) events, such as natural hazards, manmade errors, and cyber-attacks, as well as the inherent fragility of the distribution grid have propelled the development of effective resilience tools and methods for the power distribution network (PDN) to avoid catastrophic infrastructural and economical losses. Multiple resilience evaluation frameworks are proposed in the literature in order to assist distribution system operators (DSOs) in managing their networks when faced with exogenous threats. We conduct detailed analysis of existing quantitative resilience studies in both electric and telecommunication domains of a PDN, focusing on event type, metrics, temporal phases, uncertainty, and critical load. Our work adopts the standpoint of a DSO, whose target is to identify feasible resilience assessment frameworks, which apply to pre-defined requirements in terms of resilience evaluation objectives (planning, reactive response, or simple assessment), time of evaluation, and available enhancement strategies. Finally, results and observations on selected works are presented, followed by discussion of identified challenges and opportunities. © 2021 by the authors.

Mechanical final elements of SISs often become vulnerable with time due to degradations, but the particulars in SIS operations and assessment impede the adaption of state-of-art research results on maintenances into this domain. This paper models the degradation of SIS final element as a stochastic process. Based on the observed information during a proof test, it is essential to determine an optimal maintenance strategy by choosing a preventive maintenance (PM) or corrective maintenance (CM), as well deciding what degree of mitigation of degradation is enough in case of a PM. When the reasonable initiation situation of a PM and the optimal maintenance degree are identified, lifetime cost of the final element can be minimized while keeping satisfying the integrity level requirement for the SIS. A numerical example is introduced to illustrate how the presenting methods are used to examine the effects of maintenance strategies on cost and the average probability of failure on demands (PFDavg) of a SIS. Intervals of the upcoming tests thus can be updated to provide maintenance crews with more clues on cost-effective tests without weakening safety. © 2019 The Authors","Degradation; Final element; Maintenance strategy; PFD<sub>avg</sub>                             ; Preventive maintenance; Safety-instrumented system","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Degradation; Numerical methods; Random processes; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Surveying instruments; Corrective maintenance; Final elements; Maintenance strategies; Optimal maintenance; PFDavg; Preventive maintenance (pm); Probability of failure on demand; Safety instrumented systems; Preventive maintenance","","","","","EU Marie Curie RISE; RISEN; Marie Curie; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201706440015, 691135)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by China Scholarship Council (201706440015), and the secondment opportunities for joint research provided by the RISEN project (No 691135) under EU Marie Curie RISE program.; Funding text 2: The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by China Scholarship Council ( 201706440015 ), and the secondment opportunities for joint research provided by the RISEN project (No 691135 ) under EU Marie Curie RISE program.

Most of the existing works on selective maintenance assumed that after each mission, the components’ states can be precisely known without additional efforts. In engineering scenarios, the states of the components in a system need to be revealed by inspections that are usually inaccurate. Inspection activities also consume the limited resources shared with maintenance activities. We, thus, put forth a novel decision framework for selective maintenance of partially observable systems with which maintenance and inspection activities will be scheduled in a holistic and interactively sequential manner. As the components’ states are partially observable and the remaining resources are fully observable, we formulate a finite-horizon Mixed Observability Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) model to support the optimization. In the MOMDP model, both maintenance and inspection actions can be interactively and sequentially planned based on the distributions of components’ states and the remaining resources. To improve the solution efficiency of the MOMDP model, we customize a Deep Value Network (DVN) algorithm in which the maximum mission success probability is approximated. A five-component system and a real-world multi-state coal transportation system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is shown that the probability of the system successfully completing the next mission can be significantly increased by taking inspections into account. The results also demonstrate the computational efficiency of the customized DVN algorithm. © Copyright © 2022 “IISE”.","deep reinforcement learning; deep value network; inspection strategy; interactively sequential decision; partially observable systems; Selective maintenance","Computational efficiency; Condition based maintenance; Deep learning; Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; Deep reinforcement learning; Deep value network; Inspection strategy; Interactively sequential decision; Maintenance and inspections; Partially observable systems; Reinforcement learnings; Selective maintenance; Sequential decisions; Value network; Inspection","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71922006)","The authors acknowledge the grant support received from the National Natural Science Fundation of China under contract number 71922006.

These novel applications, on the other hand, bring new challenges to network resilience. Among them, traffic variation is one of the most vital threats to the 5G network. With tens of thousands of devices connected to the network, network service resilience is threatened by the heavy traffic change induced by the end users or malicious attacks. While long timescale traffic variation can be easily predicted based on historical data, short timescale abnormal traffic is hard to forecast yet can significantly violate the service requirements. The impact of short timescale traffic variation can be mitigated by 5G management and control systems. However, the complexity and dynamics of the virtualized 5G system make it hard to estimate its resilience. This paper provides a 5G network model that captures the data traffic changes and network dynamic management mechanism. The model is able to evaluate the performance of different network services with different requirements under traffic variation events. We analyze the effectiveness of auto-scaling and compare different isolation strategies for traffic congestion. The simulation results on service resilience estimation can become strong supporting information for 5G network deployment and configuration.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","5G; auto-scaling; communication networks; discrete event simulation; Kubernetes; network resilience; network service; Petri Net; traffic variation; virtual networks","Analytical models; Costs; Discrete event simulation; Information management; Petri nets; Queueing networks; Reliability; Traffic congestion; 5g; 5g mobile communication; Auto-scaling; Communications networks; Discrete-event simulations; Kubernetes; Mobile communications; Network resilience; Networks services; Resilience; Resource management; Scalings; Traffic variation; Virtual networks; 5G mobile communication systems","","","","","","","Perspectives on Vertical Industries and Implications for 5G, (2016); Jiang D., Liu G., An overview of 5G requirements, 5G Mobile Communications., pp. 3-26, (2017); Yousaf F.Z., Bredel M., Schaller S., Schneider F., NFV and SDN-Key technology enablers for 5G networks, IEEE J.

This makes smart grids vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this paper, we study the false pricing attacks and model the interaction between attackers and defenders using a zero-sum Markov game, where neither player has full knowledge of the game model. A multi-agent reinforcement learning method is used to solve the Markov game and find the Nash Equilibrium policies for both players. An application to a simple radial power distribution system is worked out. The results show that the proposed algorithm can help the players find mixed strategies to maximize their long-term return.

The mechanical actuator subsystem in a SIS can become more vulnerable with time due to progressive degradation mechanisms, such as erosion, corrosion and wear-out etc. Such kind of phenomenon challenges the assumption of constant failure rates or exponentially distributed lifetime that the existing reliability analysis depends on. This study aims to assess the performance of the actuator of a SIS subject to a continuous degradation, which will be modeled by homogeneous gamma process. Periodic tests with the interval τ are executed to check the subsystem state. A combining maintenance strategy including corrective maintenances (CMs) and imperfect preventive maintenances (PMs) will be adapted according to the state, which can be evaluated by actual degradation level. Given that maintenances are triggered only at inspection dates, the actuator can experience downtime in cases of failures. The expected downtime in each test interval will be used to estimate the average unavailability of the SIS. A numerical example is shown that the average unavailability of such a SIS sub-system is changing with time rather than keeping as a constant value. © 2019 European Safety and Reliability Association.

The number of EVs and charging facilities is expected to increase significantly in the near future, making the existing transportation systems increasingly coupled with the electrical power systems. These growing couplings may bring new stresses and risks to both systems. However, the failure of electric vehicles charging facilities have not been considered. In this context, this paper investigates the resilience of an electrified transportation network (ETN) under potential failures of its supporting charging facilities. Specifically, a two-staged system optimal dynamic traffic assignment model is proposed to describe characteristics of an ETN such as the configuration of charging stations, travel ranges of EVs and the state of charge of EVs. This model is based on the cell transmission model (CTM) and two metrics are presented to quantify the ETN performance under the scenario of charging facility failures. A numerical example is studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ETN resilience analysis framework.

A hierarchical framework is first developed for evaluating the trustworthiness of the risk assessment. The evaluation is based on two main attributes (criteria), i.e., the strength of knowledge supporting the assessment and the fidelity of the risk assessment model. These two attributes are further broken down into sub-attributes and, finally, leaf attributes. The trustworthiness is calculated using a weighted average of the leaf attributes, in which the weights are calculated using the Dempster Shafer Theory-Analytical Hierarchy Process (DST-AHP). Risk aggregation is, then, performed by a “weighted posterior” method, considering the level of trustworthiness. An application to the risk aggregation of two hazard groups in Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) is illustrated. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Multi-hazards risk aggregation (MHRA); Nuclear power plants (NPP); Quantitative risk assessment (QRA); Risk-informed decision making; Strength of knowledge (SoK); Trustworthiness in risk assessment","Decision making; Hazards; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Dempster-Shafer theory; Quantitative risk assessment; Risk aggregations; Risk assessment models; Risk-informed decision making; Strength of knowledge (SoK); Weighted averages; article; decision making; nuclear power plant; plant leaf; risk assessment; Risk assessment","","","","","","","Aregui A., Denoeux T., Constructing consonant belief functions from sample data using confidence sets of pignistic probabilities, Int.

The reason for this is that decisions in different disciplines, such as design, operations and maintenance, are made independently of each other. This can lead to a large degree of conservativeness. In this paper, we present a unified approach for maintenance- and production planning, which reduces the conservativeness and leads to more economical operation. We model the system using differential equations and then formulate the problem of optimal operation as a numerical optimization problem. The problem is a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), which we solve using off-the-shelf optimization software. Some model approximations were made to make the system numerically tractable. We demonstrate the method on a subsea-inspired case example. © 2019 European Safety and Reliability Association.

Grid control is even more critical during extreme events as the WAC function is required to orchestrate the response to contingencies and enhance the power system resilience through failure localization, isolation, and service restoration. Both power and telecommunication domains are involved in control applications, giving rise to multiple cyber-physical interdependencies. This paper proposes a resilience-based optimization of the distribution service restoration (DSR) by coordinating strategies of crew dispatch and manual/remote switches operation. The telecommunication service and underlying infrastructure are identified as main enablers of the co-optimization as all considered resilience strategies communicate with the control center that collects crisis management information. Therefore, the availability of telecom points in terms of power supply is examined in this work. Failure propagation in the coupled power-telecom network is highlighted, and differences in failure propagation between overhead and underground power lines are explored. The proposed approach is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, evaluated under a multi-feeder interdependent power-telecom test network. Results show that combined scheduling of resilience strategies as well as prioritization of power supply to telecom points-of-interest, yield an enhanced recovery strategy.

Countries have shown different preparedness levels for promptly implementing disease detection strategies, via mass testing and isolation of identified cases, which led to a largely varying impact of the outbreak on the populations and health-care systems. In this paper, we propose a new pandemic resource allocation model for allocating limited disease detection and control resources, in particular testing capacities, in order to limit the spread of a pandemic. The proposed model is a novel epidemiological compartmental model formulated as a non-linear programming model that is suitable to address the inherent non-linearity of an infectious disease progression within the population. A number of novel features are implemented in the model to take into account important disease characteristics, such as asymptomatic infection and the distinct risk levels of infection within different segments of the population. Moreover, a method is proposed to estimate the vulnerability level of the different communities impacted by the pandemic and to explicitly consider equity in the resource allocation problem. The model is validated against real data for a case study of COVID-19 outbreak in France and our results provide various insights on the optimal testing intervention time and level, and the impact of the optimal allocation of testing resources on the spread of the disease among regions. The results confirm the significance of the proposed modeling framework for informing policymakers on the best preparedness strategies against future infectious disease outbreaks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","(S) decision support systems; COVID-19; Disaster preparedness; Non-linear programming; Pandemic control","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Disaster prevention; Disease control; Diseases; Resource allocation; SARS; (S) decision support system; Control strategies; COVID-19; Detection and controls; Disaster preparedness; Disease detection; Non-linear programming; Optimization models; Pandemic control; Testing strategies; Nonlinear programming","","","","","","","Alberti P.M., Lantz P.M., Wilkins C.H., Equitable pandemic preparedness and rapid response: lessons from COVID-19 for pandemic health equity, Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law, 45, 6, pp. 921-935, (2020); Aleta A., Martin-Corral D., y Piontti A.P., Ajelli M., Litvinova M., Chinazzi M., Merler S., Et al., Modelling the impact of testing, contact tracing and household quarantine on second waves of COVID-19, Nature Human Behaviour, 4, 9, pp. 964-971, (2020); Braithwaite I., Callender T., Bullock M., Aldridge R.W., Automated and partly automated contact tracing: A systematic review to inform the control of COVID-19, The Lancet Digital Health, 2, 11, pp. e607-e621, (2020); Braveman P., Health disparities and health equity: Concepts and measurement, Annual Review of Public Health, 27, pp. 167-194, (2006); Buhat C.A.H., Duero J.C.C., Felix E.F.O., Rabajante J.F., Mamplata J.B., Optimal allocation of COVID-19 test kits among accredited testing centers in the philippines, Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research, pp. 1-16, (2020); Buyuktahtakin I.E., des Bordes E., Kibis E.Y., A new epidemics–logistics model: Insights into controlling the Ebola virus disease in west Africa, European Journal of Operational Research, 265, 3, pp. 1046-1063, (2018); Dasaklis T.K., Pappis C.P., Rachaniotis N.P., Epidemics control and logistics operations: A review, International Journal of Production Economics, 139, 2, pp. 393-410, (2012); Dimitrov N.B., Meyers L.A., Mathematical approaches to infectious disease prediction and control, Risk and optimization in an uncertain world, pp. 1-25, (2010); Dong E., Du H., Gardner L., An interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 20, 5, pp. 533-534, (2020); van den Driessche P., Deterministic compartmental models: Extensions of basic models, pp. 147-157), (2008); Duffey R.B., Zio E., Prediction of COVID-19 infection, transmission and recovery rates: A new analysis and global societal comparisons, Safety Science, 129, (2020); (2020); Eisenhandler O., Tzur M., The humanitarian pickup and distribution problem, Operations Research, 67, 1, pp. 10-32, (2018); Ferguson N., Laydon D., Nedjati-Gilani G., Imai N., Ainslie K., Baguelin M., Cuomo-Dannenburg G., Et al., Report 9: Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand, Imperial College London, 10, (2020); Guan L., Prieur C., Zhang L., Prieur C., Georges D., Bellemain P., Transport effect of COVID-19 pandemic in France, Annual Reviews in Control, 50, (2020); He S., Peng Y., Sun K., Seir modeling of the COVID-19 and its dynamics, Nonlinear Dynamics, 101, 3, pp. 1667-1680, (2020); Hogg J.D., Scott J.A., HSL_MA97: A bit-compatible multifrontal code for sparse symmetric systems, (2011); Hsiang S., Allen D., Annan-Phan S., Bell K., Bolliger I., Chong T., Krasovich E., Et al., The effect of large-scale anti-contagion policies on the COVID-19 pandemic, Nature, 584, 7820, pp. 262-267, (2020); Iwata K., Miyakoshi C., A simulation on potential secondary spread of novel coronavirus in an exported country using a stochastic epidemic SEIR model, Journal of Clinical Medicine, 9, 4, (2020); Jordan R.E., Adab P., Cheng K.K., COVID-19: Risk factors for severe disease and death, (2020); Kermack W.O., McKendrick A.G., A contribution to the mathematical theory of epidemics, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

This may bring new stresses and risks to such a system of systems. This paper presents a mathematical framework to analyze the resilience of an electrified road network (ERN) subject to potential failures of its supporting fast-charging stations (FCSs). Within this framework, a novel linear optimization model is proposed for the first time to solve the system optimal dynamic traffic assignment problem of ERN. The characteristics considered in the modeling framework include the location, capacity, and charging speed of FCSs, as well as the driving range, charging time, and state of charge (SoC) of EVs. The linear model is proposed based on the cell transmission model. It is used as the first-stage model to assign the traffic under normal FCS operations. A second-stage model is, then, extended to minimize the total travel time after the stochastic occurrence of FCS failures, that is, in the failure and recovery phases. Two metrics are considered to quantify the ERN performance and the impacts of FCS failures. A numerical example is studied to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework for analyzing ERN resilience. The results show that deploying FCSs near the highway entrances and maintaining their operation are relevant factors to enhance the system's resilience. The analysis can provide guidelines to the system operators for effective management of the ERN operation and identify resilience-critical FCSs for system resilience improvement. © 2021 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering","","Battery management systems; Combinatorial optimization; Fast charging (Batteries); Linear programming; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Stages; Stochastic systems; System of systems; Traffic control; Travel time; Cell transmission model; Effective management; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Failure and recoveries; Fast charging stations; Linear optimization model; Mathematical frameworks; Transportation system; conceptual framework; electric vehicle; numerical model; stochasticity; transportation system; Stochastic models","","","","","Department of Energy of Politecnico di Milano; Department of Excellence, (2018‐2022); MUR; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201606990003)","The participation of Hongping Wang to this research is supported by China Scholarship Council (No. 201606990003).

The mechanical units of SISs can become vulnerable with time due to specific deterioration processes, which lead to a degrading system performance. Such phenomenon thus challenges the assumption of constant failure rate or exponentially distributed lifetime that the existing reliability analysis depends on. Meanwhile, redundant architecture is widely used to improve system availability and guarantee system performance meeting specific requirement, and periodic proof tests are executed to check system status. Given the unavoidable deterioration processes, an intermediate state of one unit can be observed to facilitate system performance analysis. Such a unit has three states according to the actual performance in proof tests, including working, degraded and failed states. This study aims to assess the performance of a 1-out-of-2 redundant system subject to degrading units. Different maintenance strategies are adopted to estimate system performance and cumulative maintenance cost, the two criteria in system lifecycle assessment after installation. A numerical example is conducted to illustrate the mentioned redundant system performance and maintenance strategies. © ESREL2020-PSAM15 Organizers.","Multiphase markov process; PFDavg; Redundant structure; Safety-instrumented system; Three-state unit","Availability; Deterioration; Failure analysis; Life cycle; Maintenance; Safety engineering; Surveying instruments; Constant failure rate; Deterioration process; Maintenance strategies; Performance analysis; Redundant architecture; Safety instrumented systems; System availability; System performance analysis; Reliability analysis","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201706440015)","The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by China Scholarship Council (201706440015).","Babishin V, Hajipour Y, Taghipour S., Optimisation of non-periodic inspection and maintenance for multicomponent systems, Eksploatacja i Niezawodnosc - Maintenance and Reliability, 20, 2, pp. 327-342, (2018); Bukowski J.

A literature search is conducted systematically based on pre-defined protocols. The resulting papers are first analyzed through a meta-data and bibliometric analysis, in which the trend of publication growth, important publication sources and authors, collaboration among the authors are identified. The evolution of research topics in three time periods (prior to mid-1990s, mid-1990s - 2010 and 2010 - present) is also discussed through a semantic clustering. Then, the most important papers from the literature search are chosen for a content analysis and critical review. The main results of the critical literature review include: First, we summarize the dependent failure behavior in different system hierarchies, i.e., failure mechanism level, component level, system level and systems-of-systems level. In each level, the main dependent failure behavior from literature is discussed with examples. Second, we develop a classification framework for the dependent failure behavior models. The most frequently-used models in each category are critically reviewed, based on which we identify five challenging problems the current dependency models face, give our perspectives on their possible solutions, and discuss future research opportunities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Dependent failure behavior; Reliability; Risk","Failure (mechanical); Semantics; Behaviour models; Bibliometrics analysis; Dependent failure; Dependent failure behavior; Failure behaviors; Literature reviews; Literature search; Research topics; System levels; Time-periods; Reliability","","","","","SNCF; Orange; Université Paris-Saclay; Electricité de France, EDF","The research of Zhiguo Zeng is financially supported by ANR, France under grant number ANR-22-CE10-0004 .

In this paper, we consider resilience modeling and analysis for multi-state systems, whose performances are characterized by discrete, rather than continuous variables. A non-homogeneous Semi-Markov reward process model is developed for resilience analysis of multi-state systems. In the developed model, system performance changes, caused by either disruptive events or system recoveries, are modeled as state transitions, and rewards are used to model financial losses incurred during and after the disruptions. Four resilience metrics are defined to quantify different aspects of resilience. As the developed model is non-homogeneous, it can capture time-dependent system behaviors and their impact on system resilience. An efficient resilience analysis algorithm is also designed based on linear interpolation and implemented using vectorization. The computational benefits of the developed algorithm are demonstrated through two numerical experiments. We apply the developed method on two practical case studies, an oil tank farm and a re-configurable computing system. The results show that the developed methods can quantify resilience of multi-state systems accurately and efficiently. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Accumulated reward; Extreme events; Multi-state system; Non-homogeneous semi-Markov process; Resilience","Losses; Oil tanks; Analysis algorithms; Continuous variables; Linear Interpolation; Multi-state system; Numerical experiments; Reconfigurable computing; Resilience metrics; Time dependent behavior; Uncertainty analysis","","","","","High-end Foreign Experts Recruitment Program of Shanghai university; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71601010); Recruitment Program of Global Experts","Funding text 1: The authors would like express their deepest gratitude to the associate editor, domain editor, and two anonymous reviewers, for their insightful comments and suggestions that help to significantly improve this paper.

It is of great significance to analyze the topological and functional characteristics of DHNs and propose design and reconstruction guidelines for vulnerability reduction. This study proposes binary tree and generalized tree models of DHNs, from which their topological characteristics can be quickly identified, and the functional analysis can be facilitated. Then, we propose a topology design and reconstruction framework for DHNs based on vulnerability assessment. Various characteristics of the branched and looped structure are studied in their influence on system vulnerability, based on which several design criteria for single-source DHNs are deduced. Specifically, single-source branched DHNs shall be designed as symmetrical to avoid long pipelines bearing enormous heat loads. When transforming the branched DHNs into looped DHNs, priority should be given to adding cotrees between the intermediate nodes of high importance, and the diameters of looped pipes should be enlarged. Finally, a detailed case study on a real-world single-source DHN demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and design criteria. © 2023","District heating network; Failure simulation; Graph theory; Topology design; Tree model; Vulnerability assessment","Binary trees; District heating; Failure (mechanical); Heating equipment; Network security; Design criteria; District heating networks; Failure simulation; Network-based; Single source; Topological characteristics; Topology design; Tree modeling; Vulnerability assessments; Vulnerability mitigation; design; heating; mitigation; risk assessment; topology; vulnerability; Graph theory","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202206120207); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFE0116100)","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2021YFE0116100 ) and the China Scholarship Council (CSC) (No. 202206120207 ).

The intrinsic degradation of each component is modelled with a pure jump Lévy process. The idea of the failure dependence is motivated by complex engineering systems where the failure of one component may cause a momentary, transient shock to the system. The effect of the shock is modelled by a random magnitude of increment in the degradation level of each surviving component. Perfect periodic inspections are carried out on the system. Upon inspection, highly deteriorated or failed components are perfectly replaced and hence are restored to an as-good-as-new state. Nothing is done to the rest of the components. For such a system, the evaluation of the reliability and the assessment of the maintenance planning are quite complex due to the failure dependence as well as the imperfect maintenance at the system level. In this study, we address these problems by the implementation of Markov renewal theory. The maintenances costs in both the short-run and long-run horizons are derived and we validate these theoretical calculations by Monte-carlo simulations. Numerical example is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model. It can provide a reference for the decision-making when developing maintenance policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Deteriorating system; Failure dependence; Markov renewal theory; Multi-component systems","Decision making; Inspection; Monte Carlo methods; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Planning; Complex engineering system; Condition based maintenance; Condition-based maintenance policy; Deteriorating system; Imperfect maintenance; Maintenance planning; Markov renewal theory; Theoretical calculations; Maintenance","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61827901, 71901026)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61827901 , 71901026 ).

Critical infrastructures are often interdependent on each other, and the topology of the interdependencies between different systems, also referred to as coupling interface, plays a key role in terms of their resilience against failures. In case of failures due to natural events, random disturbances, or deliberate attacks, the design of the coupling interface is a key factor for maintaining high performance within the interdependent CIs. However, in the existing literature, the issue of the coupling interface design is often addressed through heuristics. In this work, we propose an optimization-based mathematical approach for designing coupling interfaces between interdependent critical infrastructures under random failures. The proposed approach allows designing a coupling interface that is robust against the worst realization of a set of feasible failure scenarios. Using as case study interdependent power and gas networks, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing solutions based on network metrics-based heuristics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Coupling interface;

Finding an optimal protection plan often takes the form of a multilevel optimization problem. Recently, approaches based on distributionally robust optimization (DRO) have gained the attention of many scholars. In fact, DRO allows protecting the decision-maker from the ambiguity arising from the imprecisely identified probability distributions of the failure scenarios. In this framework, the probability distribution of the failure scenarios is assumed to be known ambiguously, and contained in an ambiguity set defined by moment-based conditions. In practice, some decisions taken in the protection plan affect the conditions of the ambiguity set. We refer to this situation as DRO with endogenous uncertainty. In this paper, we study the impact of the endogenous uncertainty on the optimal protection plan of a power network, using a numerical example built upon the IEEE 14-bus system with a traditional moment-based ambiguity set.

The number of EVs and charging facilities is expected to increase significantly in the near future, making the existing transportation systems increasingly coupled with the electrical power systems. These growing couplings may bring new stresses and risks to both systems. However, the failure of electric vehicles charging facilities have not been considered. In this context, this paper investigates the resilience of an electrified transportation network (ETN) under potential failures of its supporting charging facilities. Specifically, a two-staged system optimal dynamic traffic assignment model is proposed to describe characteristics of an ETN such as the configuration of charging stations, travel ranges of EVs and the state of charge of EVs. This model is based on the cell transmission model (CTM) and two metrics are presented to quantify the ETN performance under the scenario of charging facility failures. A numerical example is studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ETN resilience analysis framework. © ESREL2020-PSAM15 Organizers.","Cell transmission model; Charging stations; Dynamic traffic assignment; Electric vehicles; Electrified transportation network; Resilience analysis","Charging (batteries); Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Numerical methods; Safety engineering; Traffic control; Analysis frameworks; Cell transmission model; Charging facilities; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electrical power system; Potential failures; Transportation network; Transportation system; Battery management systems","","","","","Department of Energy of Politecnico di Milano; Department of Excellence, (2018-2022); MUR; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201606990003)","The participation of Hongping Wang to this research is supported by China Scholarship Council (No. 201606990003).

An efficient scheduling of maintenance tasks is key for ensuring high availability of the system and avoiding production losses and high costs from over expending. The demand of natural gas is highly dependent on weather and seasonal conditions, being higher during winter and lower during summer. Thus, the operation of the compressor stations alternates between periods of full capacity and periods of reduced capacity. The optimal planning of maintenance tasks needs to take into account such constraints from the production plans. Currently, preventive maintenance tasks are usually carried out periodically, following a calendar-based strategy. This maintenance strategy can be improved by moving to predictive maintenance in which the decisions are based on prognostics that consider both the deterioration of the system and the production profile. This work explores on the application of Piecewise-deterministic Markov Process (PDMP) as a framework for the optimization problem. The system level model captures the deterioration process of the units, the condition monitoring techniques, maintenance strategies and production profile in order to assess the performance of a maintenance strategy. © ESREL 2020-PSAM15 Organizers.

For this reason, recently few studies have started to investigate the vulnerability of a highly coupled traffic-power system in the presence of disruptive events. Actually, however, only very few of these studies have considered the impact of EVs on the interdependent traffic-power system during restoration from a disruptive event. In an attempt to fill this gap, in this study, we investigate the restoration planning of both independent RNs and PNs, and interdependent traffic-power systems. A mixed integer program model is formulated to provide optimal reconfiguration and operational solutions for post-disruption traffic-power systems recovery. The objective of the model is to minimize the total cost incurred by system performance loss, which is quantified by the cumulative unmet traffic demand for RNs and load shedding cost for PNs. Several reconfiguration strategies are considered, including links reversing in RNs and line switching in PNs, to optimize system resilience. In the proposed model, the integrated problem of system optimal dynamic traffic assignment and optimal power flow is solved to derive the optimal traffic-power flow. RNs and PNs are coupled through the coordinately allocated spatio-temporal charging demand of EVs. A partial highway network in North Carolina (NC), USA, and a modified IEEE-14 bus system are used to illustrate the application of the model. The numerical results obtained show the added value of coordinately planning restoration for traffic-power systems and the effects of different levels of EV penetration. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Fast-charging stations; Interdependent systems; Optimal traffic-power flow; Resilience; Traffic-power systems","Acoustic generators; Charging (batteries); Electric load shedding; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Integer programming; Restoration; Uncertainty analysis; Disruptive event; Fast charging stations; Interdependent systems; Optimal traffic-power flow; Power; Power flows; Power networks; Resilience; Road network; Traffic-power system; Electric load flow","","","","","Energy for Motion Project; Energy for Motion Project ?; MUR; SNCF; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201606990003); Electricité de France, EDF","Funding text 1: The participation of Hongping Wang to this research is supported by China Scholarship Council (No. 201606990003 ).

In Norway, bridges are a vital part of the transportation infrastructure. With more than 18,000 road bridges across the country, an efficient bridge management system is of critical importance to avoid high costs from over expending, to ensure safety of the public and availability of the transportation system. In the bridge management system applied by NPRA, the inspections are mainly carried out periodically based on pre-defined rules and the decision about when to perform the maintenance is based on the findings of these inspections. The objective of this paper is to propose a modelling framework that makes it possible to challenge these pre-defined rules by doing degradation prognostic and maintenance optimization. We propose to use a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process to encompass different modelling assumptions as non-negligible maintenance delays and time dependent inspections. State probabilities and performance indicators are assessed through Monte Carlo simulations and a numerical scheme. The experimental values provided at the end show that optimal maintenance and optimization strategies should be investigated and further developed. © 2019 European Safety and Reliability Association.

To analyze the performance of these systems under disruption, this paper provides a holistic multi-phase model to assess the resilience of a transportation system consisting of multiple modes. The hazard scenarios for modeling strikes of typhoons are generated by the Spatially Localized Failure (SLF) model and Monte Carlo simulation. Then based on the simulation of typhoon scenarios, we assess the resilience of both single-mode systems and a complementary system of multiple modes. This method is applied to the high-speed rail network and civil aviation network in China under different typhoon intensity scenarios. Results show the different resilience characteristics of the two networks, and more importantly unveil the complementary effect between the two modes when suffering from damages. The improvement of system resilience due to the complementary effects provides a motivation for promoting cooperation between high-speed rail and civil aviation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Monte Carlo simulation; Natural hazard; Resilience assessment; Spatially Localized Failure; Transportation networks","China; Civil aviation; Hazards; Hurricanes; Intelligent systems; Railroad transportation; Storms; Localized failure; Monte Carlo's simulation; Multiphase modeling; Multiple modes; Natural hazard; Performance; Resilience assessment; Spatially localized failure; Transportation network; Transportation system; high-speed train; Monte Carlo analysis; network analysis; railway transport; transportation development; transportation planning; typhoon; Monte Carlo methods","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72171191); Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province, (2021JM-026)","This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 72171191 ) and the Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi, China (Grant 2021JM-026 ).","Adams T.M., Bekkem K.R., Toledo-Duran E.J., Freight resilience measures, J.

Resilience assessment of emergency systems can improve emergency response capability and system functional recovery. The increasing complexity and coupling of factors in emergency response systems need to be investigated from a system resilience perspective. In this paper, we propose to integrate a multi-stage System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) with a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) for the resilience assessment of emergency response systems. In the proposed methodology, emergency response systems are viewed as multi-step emergency operations for STAMP to analyze the hierarchical control and feedback structures. The output of multi-stage STAMP in controllers, actuators, sensors, and controlled processes is applied to develop a DBN for resilience assessment. For known external shocks (e.g., natural disasters), the effects of external shocks on the system are decomposed into subsystems or components. System degradation and recovery models are established. Regarding unknown external disruption (e.g., unforeseen failure modes), degeneration and recovery are temporally integrated into the analysis of system functionality. System performance is evaluated through the combination of socio-technical factors and external disasters. Eventually, the resilience of emergency response systems is obtained from the performance curves. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can evaluate system resilience after the system suffers from external disasters. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic Bayesian network; Emergency operations; Multi-stage STAMP;

These systems are usually modeled as multiperformance multistate systems (MPMSSs). However, existing MPMSS models fail to consider an important aspect, i.e., the performance conversion process. For example, in a combined heat and power (CHP) generating unit, apart from the output heat and electricity, decision-makers are also interested in the unit's capacity to convert gas into electricity and heat. The latter is related to the performance conversion process. This article proposes a framework for the reliability evaluation of performance conversion-based MPMSS. In the proposed MPMSS model, the couplings among different types of performances inside the components are quantified into the multistate performance conversion matrix. The performance conversion structure functions are proposed to derive system performance conversion capability based on the conversion capabilities of the components. Two reliability evaluation methods considering the steady-state performance conversion process and the continuous-time performance conversion process are proposed, respectively. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the developed methods.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Multiperformance multistate system (MPMSSs); Multistate system; Performance conversion process; Reliability; Universal generating function (UGF)","Continuous time systems; Decision making; Numerical methods; Combined heat and power; Conversion process; Heat and electricity; Multi-state system; Multiple performance measures; Reliability Evaluation; Steady state performance; Structure functions; Reliability analysis","","","","","NSFC-JPI UE, (71961137004); Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe, JPI UE; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71871200)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71871200 and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation China and Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe Call (NSFC-JPI UE) under Grant 71961137004","Billinton R., Allan R., Reliability Evaluation of Engineering Systems, (1992); Lisnianski A., Levitin G., Multi-State System Reliability: Assessment, Optimization and Applications, (2003); Lisnianski A., Frenkel I., Ding Y., Multi-State System Reliability Analysis and Optimization for Engineers and IndustrialManagers, (2010); Ushakov I., Universal generating function, Sov.

The former is built from the protection activities before and during the mitigation phase of a disruptive event, and the latter is the result of the restoration efforts, which take place at the recovery phase. The total resilience of ICIs combines both of these two aspects by taking into account the preferences of the decision makers. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed modeling framework and metrics in a case study involving ICIs made of a power grid and a gas distribution system. Owing to the new resilience indicators, the priorities of subsystems and links within ICIs at different phases can be ranked; therefore, different resilience strategies at different phases of disruptive events are compared. The results show that proposed metrics can be used by stakeholders of ICIs on improving the effectiveness of system protection measurements.

Best judgment and optimistic assumptions may result in failing to meet the quantitative safety objectives, whereas conservative assumptions may increase the margins which the objectives are met with but result in cost-ineffective design or operation. In the present paper, we develop an extended framework for the analysis of the criticality of assumptions in risk assessment by evaluating the risk that deviations from the assumptions lead to a reduction of the safety margins. The framework aims to support risk-informed decision making by identifying important assumptions and integrating the assessment of their criticality into the quantitative risk assessment (QRA). The framework is, finally applied within the quantitative risk assessment of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) exposed to external flooding. Compared to previous works on the subject, we consider also conservative assumptions and introduce decision flow diagrams to support the classification of the criticality of the assumptions. The framework provides a more comprehensive and transparent evaluation of the assumptions deviation risk through the decision flow diagrams that facilitate the standardization of the evaluation of the assumption deviation effects on the risk assessment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Assumption deviation;

The mechanical units of SISs can become vulnerable with time due to specific deterioration processes, which lead to a degrading system performance. Such phenomenon thus challenges the assumption of constant failure rate or exponentially distributed lifetime that the existing reliability analysis depends on. Meanwhile, redundant architecture is widely used to improve system availability and guarantee system performance meeting specific requirement, and periodic proof tests are executed to check system status. Given the unavoidable deterioration processes, an intermediate state of one unit can be observed to facilitate system performance analysis. Such a unit has three states according to the actual performance in proof tests, including working, degraded and failed states. This study aims to assess the performance of a 1-out-of-2 redundant system subject to degrading units. Different maintenance strategies are adopted to estimate system performance and cumulative maintenance cost, the two criteria in system lifecycle assessment after installation. A numerical example is conducted to illustrate the mentioned redundant system performance and maintenance strategies. © ESREL2020-PSAM15 Organizers.
