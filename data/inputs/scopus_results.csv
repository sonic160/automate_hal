The smart distribution grid (SDG) is thereby at the core of proposed system enhancements, due to its high fragility as well as being the interface to most newly intro-duced grid applications (distributed energy resources, electrical vehicles, industrial Internet-of- Things, etc.). The SDG can be characterized by the type of lines composing the feeders (over-head and/or underground) and deployed intelligent electronic devices (IED) that allow efficient monitoring, protection, and control of the system. This paper proposes an optimization formulation to enhance the resilience of overhead and underground networks, while considering the coupling between power grid operation and the communicating remote-controlled switches (RCS). Novel radiality constraints are introduced to guarantee the tree structure during operation. Results from testing the model in a real network show the validity of proposed radiality constraints and quantify the gap in terms of achieved resilience between full overhead and hybrid overhead-underground networks.  © 2023 IEEE.","Communication; Optimization; Overhead and Under-ground Networks; Radiality; Resilience; Smart Grid","Electric power distribution; Electric power system control; Electric power system protection; Energy resources; Overhead lines; Remote control; Trees (mathematics); Ground networks; Modeling and optimization; Optimisations; Overhead and under-ground network; Radiality; Resilience; Restoration model; Smart distribution grids; Smart grid; Underground networks; Smart power grids","","","","","","","; ","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 IEEE Power and Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference, ISGT 2023","16 January 2023 through 19 January 2023","Washington","187411","","978-166545355-4","","","English","IEEE Power Energy Soc.

We develop a model that considers the ages and residual values of the non-failed components and component failure time distributions. We also consider the structural and economical dependency between the items by favoring grouped over individual replacement to reduce operation costs. We use a genetic algorithm to derive the optimal opportunistic maintenance plan by minimizing the long-run operational cost considering both maintenance cost and potential penalty costs due to failure in the future. The model recommends additional preventive operations in cases where the reliability does not satisfy the quality condition and to reduce the long-run operational cost. A sensitivity analysis shows that the optimal decision is mainly affected by the logistic cost, the interest rate, and the planning horizon. The model’s performance has been evaluated using several real case problems, demonstrating that the proposed method is very efficient. © 2023 by SCITEPRESS–Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Economic Dependence; Multi-Component Systems; Opportunistic Maintenance; Reliability; Structure","","","","","","SNCF; Orange; Université Paris-Saclay; Electricité de France, EDF","The research of Zhiguo Zeng is partially financially supported by ANR under grant number ANR-22-CE10-0004 and the chaire of Risk and Resilience of Complex Systems (Chaire EDF, Orange and SNCF).

For plants exposed to multiple hazards, Multi-Hazards Risk Aggregation (MHRA) is necessary to inform decisions. In practice, this is often done by a simple arithmetic summation over the different risk contributors, without taking into account that the state of knowledge of the risk models of the different hazards can be quite different. In this paper, we provide a hierarchical framework to assess the strength of knowledge that PRA models are based upon. The framework is organized in three attributes characterizing the knowledge which a PRA model is based upon (assumptions, data, phenomenological understanding). These attributes are further broken down into sub-attributes and, finally, “leaf ” attributes that can be evaluated. The PRA models of two hazards groups for Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) are considered and the strength of knowledge behind each model is assessed using the developed framework. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","","Decision making; Hazards; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Reliability; Broken down; Knowledge assessment; Multi-hazards; Multiple hazards; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Risk aggregations; Risk metrics; Risk-informed decision making; Risk assessment","","","","","","","","van Gulijk C.; Haugen S.; Barros A.; Vinnem J.E.; Kongsvik T.","CRC Press/Balkema","","28th International European Safety and Reliability Conference, ESREL 2018","17 June 2018 through 21 June 2018","Trondheim","220589","","978-081538682-7","","","English","Saf.

Numerical indexes of functional reliability are estimated from laboratory test data or field failure data. Theses indexes are not always available to the customers. On the other hand, reliability reputation, which concerns the opinions of the general public regarding the functional performance of a given product, is dominant in affecting the purchase willingness of the customers. In this paper, we develop a new method for evaluating the reliability reputation of a given product. Numerical metrics are first defined to measure reliability reputation. Online customer's reviews are collected and used as data for reliability reputation assessment. Text mining algorithms are used to extract information regarding the reliability of the product and the maintenance service of the company. Finally, an integrated approach is proposed to evaluate the reliability reputation. A case study is conducted to demonstrate the validity of the developed methods.

Traditional PF is a recursive Bayesian filtering framework that updates the posterior probability density function of RULs when new observation data become available. In engineering practice, due to the limited accuracy of monitoring/inspection techniques, the observation data available for PF are inevitably imprecise and often need to be treated as interval data. In this article, a novel Interval Particle Filtering (IPF) approach is proposed to effectively leverage such interval-valued observations for RUL prediction. The IPF is built on three pillars: (i) an interval contractor that mitigates the error explosion problem when the epistemic uncertainty in the interval-valued observation data is propagated; (ii) an interval intersection method for constructing the likelihood function based on the interval observation data; and (iii) an interval kernel smoothing algorithm for estimating the unknown parameters in the IPF. The developed methods are applied on the interval-valued capacity data of batteries and fatigue crack growth data of railroad tracks. The results demonstrate that the developed methods could improve the performance of RUL predictions based on interval observation data. © Copyright © 2022 “IISE”.","epistemic uncertainty; imprecise observation; interval kernel smoothing; Interval particle filtering; remaining useful life","Forecasting; Gaussian noise (electronic); Monte Carlo methods; Probability density function; Uncertainty analysis; Epistemic uncertainties; Imprecise observation; Interval kernel smoothing; Interval particle filtering; Interval-valued; Kernel smoothing; Observation data; Particle Filtering; Remaining useful life predictions; Remaining useful lives; Fatigue crack propagation","","","","","","","Y.

However, most studies focus on point RUL prognostics, with limited insights into the uncertainty associated with these estimates. This limits the applicability of such RUL prognostics to maintenance planning, which is per definition a stochastic problem. In this paper, we therefore develop probabilistic RUL prognostics using Convolutional Neural Networks. These prognostics are further integrated into maintenance planning, both for single and multiple components. We illustrate our approach for aircraft turbofan engines. The results show that the optimal replacement time for the engines is close to the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval of the RUL estimates. We also show that our proposed maintenance approach leads to a cost reduction of 53% compared to a traditional Time-based maintenance strategy. Moreover, compared with the ideal case when the true RUL is known in advance (perfect RUL prognostics), our approach leads to a limited number of failures. Overall, this paper proposes an end-to-end framework for data-driven predictive maintenance for multiple components, and showcases the potential benefits of data-driven predictive maintenance on cost and reliability. © 2023 The Author(s)","Aircraft; C-MAPSS turbofan engines; Maintenance scheduling; Predictive maintenance planning; Probabilistic remaining useful life prognostics","Aircraft engines; Condition based maintenance; Condition monitoring; Cost reduction; Turbofan engines; Uncertainty analysis; C-MAPSS turbofan engine; Data driven; Maintenance planning; Maintenance scheduling; Multiple components; Predictive maintenance; Predictive maintenance planning; Probabilistic remaining useful life prognostic; Probabilistics; Remaining useful lives; Stochastic systems","","","","","SNCF; EDF Energy","The research contribution of Anne Barros and Zhiguo Zeng is partially supported by Chair of Risk and Resilience of Complex Systems (Chair EDF, SNCF and Orange), France .","M.

These safety barriers, although designed to operate in different phases of the accidents evolution, are often optimized separately, without considering their collective effects on preventing disruptions and quickly recovering from the disruptions. This paper develops a joint optimization model for synthetically optimizing safety barriers of different natures, including prevention, mitigation, emergency and recovery barriers to enhance the business continuity of the NPP, considering the threat of steam generator tube rupture (SGTR) accidents. The joint optimization is guided by a business continuity metric called expected business continuity value (EBCV). A physics-of-failure model is developed to describe the crack growth process of the steam generator tube and to model the effect of the prevention barriers, i.e., periodical inspection of the crack length. An event tree model is developed to describe the evolution of the SGTR-initiated accident and to model the effect of the mitigation and emergency barriers. Recovery measures are also considered via a widely-used logarithmic function model. A mixed-integer genetic algorithm (MIGA) is used to obtain optimal solutions of the joint optimization model. The results show that the developed joint optimization model can achieve better performance in terms of business continuity, compared to the conventional methods that optimize the safety barriers separately. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Business continuity management (BCM); Event tree (ET); Joint optimization; Mixed-integer genetic algorithm (MIGA); Nuclear power plant (NPP); Safety barrier; Steam generator tube rupture (SGTR)","Descaling; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Recovery; Steam power plants; Tubes (components); Uncertainty analysis; Continuous operation; Conventional methods; Logarithmic functions; Mixed-integer genetic algorithms; Periodical inspection; Physics of failure models; Steam generator tube; Steam generator tube ruptures; Steam generators","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201506450020)","The work of Dr. Jinduo Xing is supported by China Scholarship Council (No. 201506450020).","Z.

Evaluating such designs through conventional life tests is difficult as the affordable test time is too short to generate a meaningful amount of failure data. In this paper, we design and implement an accelerated life test (ALT) for evaluating the reliability of pneumatic cylinders. From a detailed analysis of failed samples from field operation, the major failure mechanisms that affect the reliability of pneumatic cylinders are identified, e.g., wear and tear of sealing rings. For these failure mechanisms, temperature and frequency are found out to be the significant stresses of the pneumatic cylinders. A two-factor-four-level full-factor design of ALT is, then, performed to set up an ALT plan for the pneumatic cylinders. A total number of 95 samples are tested according to the ALT plan, and a mixed Arrhenius-inverse-power-law model is used to fit the test data and predict the reliability under normal operation conditions. In addition, a normal stress test of eight samples is performed to validate the reliability predicted by the ALT.

Modern CIs rely on the fifth generation of mobile communication (5G) paradigm to incorporate new technologies, deliver new sophisticated services and adopt new business models. These models will shift the CI interdependencies towards a new dynamic paradigm where communication resources are deployed within the CIs operational scheme to reach performance and quality of service (QoS) objectives. Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Network Slicing (NS) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) are examples of 5G-enabling technologies used to reach the aforementioned objectives. However, due to the complex nature of CIs and the interdependencies between their components, the shift toward a dynamic operational scheme will increase the vulnerability and exposure to risks, impacting the network resilience. This requires the design of new resilience frameworks that consider the heterogeneity, privacy and self-interest nature of CIs and guarantee reliability and QoS objectives in such a constrained and dynamic environment. To tackle the resilience problem, we propose a framework to dynamically coordinate and manage the deployment of communications resources, based on NFV. This framework will ensure the availability of services, meet performance objectives during disruptive events and overcome constraints of interdependencies and heterogeneity. To illustrate our approach, we formulate the case of maintenance operations as a disruptive event in ICT hosting SG services. © ESREL 2021.

With the digital transformation, all industry sectors will develop new applications with new requirements regarding telecommunication networks that 5G should be able to meet. To meet the requirement of future 5G use cases and applications, it is crucial to study the complexity of such network system by distinguishing different parts, layers, components as well as their interdependencies. This paper describes the 5G networks from an End-to-End perspective (device, radio network, core network, data network) and from a multi-layer perspective (orchestration, virtualisation/containerization and infrastructure) to show how this system (or system of systems) is complex, especially when we address resilience challenges. Resilience requirements and challenges are further explained by proposing relevant scenarios and use cases. In this paper, we mainly intend to highlight 5G network complexity and open a discussion on methodologies to model such complex network for its resilience study with the hope that this paper could inspire the future study of researchers in the related field. © ESREL 2021.

The impact of epistemic uncertainty on the result of the risk assessment is, then, estimated based on the developed maturity model.

In practice, the behaviors of the systems affected by these extreme events are often modeled by multistate models to facilitate the analysis. In this paper, we develop a generic framework for resilience modeling and analysis of multistate energy systems. A multistate resilience model is developed based on a Markov reward process model, where the degradation and recovery of system performance are characterized by a continuous time discrete state Markov chain and the losses caused by the extreme event is modeled by the reward rates associated with the sojourns in the degradation states and the transitions among the states. Four numerical metrics are defined to describe different aspects of system resilience, i.e. the resistant, absorption, recovery and overall resilience. A simulation-based algorithm is proposed for resilience analysis of multistate energy systems. The developed methods are applied for resilience modeling and analysis of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) under the threat of earthquakes. The Markov reward process model is developed following a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, a fragility analysis and an event tree modeling of accident evolutions. Both a time-static and time-dependent resilience analysis are conducted and the results show that the developed model is able to comprehensively describe the resilience of multistate energy systems under the threats of extreme events. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Accumulated reward; Energy system; Extreme events; Markov reward model; Multistate system; Resilience","Continuous time systems; Earthquakes; Markov chains; Nuclear fuels; Event tree modeling; Fragility analysis; Generic frameworks; Markov reward process; Markov reward process model; Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis; Simulation-based algorithms; System resiliences; Nuclear power plants","","","","","High-end Foreign Experts Recruitment Program of Shanghai university; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71601010, 71901138)","Funding text 1: This work was finished during Dr. Shijia Du’s visit to Université Paris-Saclay.

CIs are often interconnected to, and interdependent on, each other through complex coupling interfaces. Failures can propagate among different CIs through these coupling interfaces, causing multi-sectoral disruption. The design of the coupling interface can strongly impact the cascading effect between different CIs. In this paper, we propose a data-driven distributionally robust approach for the optimal coupling of interdependent CIs. Our model obtains an optimal coupling interface that maximizes the expected combined performance of interdependent CIs under random failure scenarios with ambiguous probability distributions. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach using an ambiguity set built upon a synthetic data set of historical contingency scenarios. Interdependent power and gas networks (IPGNs) are used as an illustrative case study. We show that our proposed approach leads to better coupling interfaces with higher expected performance under disruptive scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Coupling interface; Distributionally robust optimization; Interdependent critical infrastructures; Random failures; Risk analysis","Critical infrastructures; Failure (mechanical); Optimization; Probability distributions; Public works; Risk assessment; Coupling interfaces; Data driven; Distributionally robust optimization; Energy systems; Interdependent critical infrastructure; Performance; Random failures; Robust approaches; Robust optimization; Transportation network; Risk analysis","","","","","","","A.

However, when elicited, expert knowledge is often imprecise with large uncertainty. Moreover, as experts usually own different expertise and knowledge, the elicited knowledge from different experts might be conflicting. In this article, a two-stage optimization model is put forth to fuse the imprecise and conflicting information from multiple sources to assess reliability of multistate systems. The degradation of the components in the multistate system is modeled via imprecise Markov models. Then, in the first-stage optimization, upper and lower bounds of the degradation model parameters are determined by minimizing the conflict between the prediction of the model and the multisource imprecise information elicited from experts. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is tailored to solve the computational problems brought by the presence of high-dimensional decision variables and resolve the optimization problem. The second-stage optimization is, then, conducted to identify the upper and lower bounds of the system reliability function given that the degradation model parameters are constrained in the bounds obtained from the first-stage optimization. A numerical example, along with a radar display and control system, is used to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Multisource imprecise information; multistate system (MSS); reliability assessment; two-stage optimization","Constrained optimization; Markov processes; Numerical methods; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radar displays; Bayes method; Imprecise information; Multi-Sources; Multi-state system; Multisource imprecise information; Multistate system; Optimisations; Reliability assessments; Two stage optimizations; Uncertainty; Upper Bound; Reliability analysis","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71771039, 71922006)","This work was support by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71922006 and Grant 71771039.","Y.

In real-life cases, considering that multiple different MSWKNS structures are provided beforehand, system designers need to select an optimal one among numbers of different structure designs. Thus, screening of the optimal MSWKNS structure is meaningful and critical. Moreover, the system reliability becomes an increasingly important factor that should be assessed in structure screening. However, when facing a large-scale MSWKNS whose number of states is enormous, exact reliability evaluation can be rather complicated. Meanwhile, due to the large number of system structure designs, the computational burden of screening can be very huge. To effectively select the optimal structure among enormous MSWKNSs under reliability constraint, an optimal structure screening method named as ordinal structure screening (OSS) is proposed. Ordinal optimization (OO) algorithm is adopted with a novel utilization of continuization discretization approximation (CDA) method. To shorten the reliability evaluation time, CDA is employed to approximate reliabilities. Based on the approximate reliabilities, OO is applied to reduce the number of system structures to be evaluated, which accelerates the screening process. Illustrative results show that the proposed method appeals in improving computational efficiency with satisfactory accuracy performance. © 2020","continuization; Discretization approximation; Multi-state weighted k-out-of-n system; Ordinal Optimization; Structure screening","Approximation algorithms; Computational efficiency; Reliability; Scales (weighing instruments); Structured programming; Computational burden; Different structure; Optimal structures; Ordinal optimization; Reliability constraints; Reliability Evaluation; System reliability; Weighted k-out-of-n system; Structural optimization","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51537010, 71871200)","This work was supported partly by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant #71871200 and #51537010 ).

The DCFP considered comprises of soft failure processes due to degradation and hard failure processes due to random shocks, where dependency arises due to the abrupt changes to the degradation processes brought by the random shocks. In practice, random shock processes are often unobservable, which makes it difficult to accurately estimate the shock intensities and predict the RUL. In the proposed method, the problem is solved recursively in a two-stage framework: in the first stage, parameters related to the degradation processes are updated using particle filtering, based on the degradation data observed through condition monitoring; in the second stage, the intensities of the random shock processes are updated using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, considering the dependency between the degradation and shock processes, and the fact that no hard failure has occurred. The updated parameters are, then, used to predict the RUL of the system. Two numerical examples are considered for demonstration purposes and a real dataset from milling machines is used for application purposes. Results show that the proposed method can be used to accurately predict the RUL in DCFP conditions. © 2018 IEEE.","Degradation; dependent competing failure processes; Markov chain Monte Carlo; particle filtering; prognostics; random shocks; remaining useful life","Bayesian networks; Condition monitoring; Data structures; Degradation; Fans; Forecasting; Markov processes; Reliability; Bayes method; Competing failure; Electric shock; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; Particle Filtering; Predictive models; prognostics; Random shocks; Remaining useful lives; Monte Carlo methods","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61573043, 71601010, 71671009); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201606020082)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61573043, Grant 71671009, and Grant 71601010, and in part by the China Scholarship Council (201606020082).","Z.

To achieve a rational result, experts from different areas should be involved, and the uncertainties in their assessments should be properly addressed. Such information is often referred to as multisource imprecise information (MSII) and might contain high degree of conflicts, as different experts usually have different expertise and knowledge. Properly quantifying the conflicts among the MSII, then, becomes a critical issue, as the subsequent processing of MSII (e.g., combination and calibration), depends on the degree of conflict in the MSII. To this end, a new conflict measure is put forth based on the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) to quantify and visualize the conflict in the MSII from a group of experts. In the first place, the MSII from each expert is used to construct the basic belief assignment (BBA) of the reliability estimates for the corresponding expert under the DST. A 2-D conflict measure, which combines the conflict factor and Jousselme distance in DST, is, then, proposed to measure the conflict between the experts' BBAs. The conflict is quantified from two perspectives, viz., mutual conflict and total conflict. Finally, a Bhattacharyya distance-based method is developed to further quantify the informativeness of each expert's MSII to the system reliability estimate. A numerical example along with an engineering case is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Bhattacharyya distance; conflict measure; Dempster-Shafer theory; multisource imprecise information (MSII); multistate system (MSS)","Probabilistic logics; Reliability theory; Bhattacharyya distance; Conflict measure; Dempster-Shafer theory; Imprecise information; Multi-Sources; Multi-state system; Multisource imprecise information; Multistate system; Reliability assessments; System reliability; Reliability analysis","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71771039, 71922006)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Contact 71922006 and Contract 71771039.","Y.

This is a type of dependence where random shock processes are influenced by degradation processes. The degradation-shock dependence is modeled by assuming that the intensity function of the nonhomogeneous Poisson process describing the random shock processes is dependent on the degradation processes. The dependence effect is modeled with reference to a classification of the random shocks in three “zones” according to their magnitudes, damage zone, fatal zone, and safety zone, with different effects on the system's failure behavior. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this type of dependence has not yet been considered in reliability models. Monte Carlo simulation is used to calculate the system reliability. A realistic application is presented with regards to the dependent failure behavior of a sliding spool, which is subject to two dependent competing failure processes, wear and clamping stagnation. It is shown that the developed model is capable of describing the dependent competing failure behaviors and their dependence. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Degradation; Degradation-shock dependence; Dependent competing failure processes; Monte Carlo simulation; Shock; Sliding spool","Degradation; Intelligent systems; Reliability; Competing failure; Degradation process; Different effects; Intensity functions; Non-homogeneous Poisson process; Realistic applications; Shock; System reliability; Monte Carlo methods","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61573043, 71231001); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201606020082)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 61573043, 71231001].

A hierarchical framework is first developed to conceptually represent the SoK in terms of three attributes (assumptions, data, phenomenological understanding), which are further broken down in sub-attributes and “leaf” attributes to facilitate their assessment in practice. The hierarchical framework, is, then, quantified in a top-down, bottom-up fashion for assessing the SoK. In the top-down phase, a reduced-order risk model is constructed to limit the complexity and number of basic elements considered in the SoK assessment. In the bottom-up phase, the SoK of each basic element in the reduced-order risk model is assessed based on predefined scoring guidelines and, then, aggregated using a weighted average of “leaf” attributes, where the weights are determined based on the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). The strength of knowledge of the basic events is in turn, aggregated using a weighted average to obtain the SoK for the whole risk assessment model. The developed methods are applied to a real-world case study, where the SoK of the Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) models of a Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) is assessed for two hazards groups, i.e., external flooding and internal events. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Event Tree (ET); Multi-Hazards Risk Aggregation (MHRA); Nuclear Power Plant (NPP); Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA); Risk-Informed Decision Making (RIDM); Strength of Knowledge (SoK)","Decision making; Hazards; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Statistical methods; Event trees; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Risk aggregations; Risk-informed decision making; Strength of Knowledge (SoK); article; decision making; flooding; nuclear power plant; plant leaf; practice guideline; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; Risk assessment","","","","","","","T.

In this respect, business continuity management (BCM) has been proposed as a comprehensive and proactive framework to prevent the disruptive events from impacting the business operations and reduce their potential damages. Most existing business continuity assessment (BCA) models that numerically quantify the business continuity are time-static, in the sense that the analysis done before operation is not updated to consider the aging and degradation of components and systems which influence their vulnerability and resistance to disruptive events. On the other hand, condition monitoring is more and more adopted in industry to maintain under control the state of components and systems. On this basis, in this work, a dynamic and quantitative method is proposed to integrate in BCA the information on the conditions of components and systems. Specifically, a particle filtering-based method is developed to integrate condition monitoring data on the safety barriers installed for system protection, to predict their reliability as their condition changes due to aging. An installment model and a stochastic price model are also employed to quantify the time-dependent revenues and tolerable losses from operating the system. A simulation model is developed to evaluate dynamic business continuity metrics originally introduced. A case study regarding a nuclear power plant (NPP) risk scenario is worked out to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Business continuity management (BCM); Condition monitoring; Dynamic business continuity assessment (DBCA); Event tree (ET); Particle filtering (PF); Prognostic and health management (PHM)","","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201506450020); Istituto Nazionale per l'Assicurazione Contro Gli Infortuni sul Lavoro, INAIL","The work of Ms. Jinduo Xing is supported by China Scholarship Council (No. 201506450020 ).

The evidential expectation-maximization algorithm is implemented in the offline phase to train the MoG-EHMM based on historical data. In the online phase, the trained model is used to recursively update the health state and reliability of a particular individual system. The predicted RUL is, then, represented in the form of its probability mass function. A numerical metric is defined based on the Bhattacharyya distance to measure the RUL prediction accuracy of the developed methods. We applied the developed methods on a simulation experiment and a real-world dataset from a bearing degradation test.

The majority of European railway networks are electrified, and power transmission networks represent usually the main power supplier. Railway and power networks share thus a unidirectional interdependency, as the railway network functionality depends on the power network. Due to this interdependency, failures in power networks have the potential of causing vast disruption in the dependent railway networks. Despite this, the issue of modeling interdependent railway and power networks has not been addressed sufficiently carefully in the existing literature. Furthermore, the treatment of cascading failures in power networks and their consequences in railway networks is limited and approximative. In this work, we propose a modeling framework which accounts for more realistic assumptions on the interconnections topology and the cascading failures dynamics. Firstly, we model the interconnections between the railway and external power network by introducing the traction power network, which acts as a bridge between the external power grid and the railway network. Secondly, we model cascading failures in the external and traction power networks with an approach based on the DC power flow model. Thirdly, we suggest a simple approach to estimate the negative consequences on the railway network due to load shedding in the traction power network. Vulnerability analysis is performed to estimate the negative consequences in the railway network due to different failure scenarios in the external power network. Sensitivity analysis on the initial assumptions is also performed. © ESREL 2021.

Maturity of the risk analysis are always different for different risk contributors, resulting in different degrees of confidence on the associated results. The difference in maturity, and the sources of heterogeneity that cause such differences, should be taken into account for supporting a reliable and accurate representation of risk in respect of DM. In this paper, we first propose a hierarchical framework to evaluate the level of maturity of risk assessments in respect of DM. The framework consists of different attributes (uncertainty, conservatism, knowledge and sensitivity) and sub-attributes (availability of data, consistency of data, data reliability, experience, and value ladenness) that are believed to determine the level of maturity of a risk assessment. Evaluation guidelines are pre-defined for facilitating the attributes scoring process. Then, the maturity level is integrated in MHRA by developing a two-dimensional risk aggregation method. Finally, a numerical case study for the MHRA of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) is carried out to show the applicability and the plausibility of the methods. © 2017 IEEE.","level of maturity; multi-hazards risk aggergation; probablistic safety assessment; risk assessment; risk-informed decision making","Decision making; Hazards; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Numerical methods; Risk analysis; Hazard risks; Level of maturity; Multi-hazard risk aggergation; Multi-hazards; Probablistic; Probablistic safety assessment; Risk aggregations; Risk-informed decision making; Risks assessments; Safety assessments; Risk assessment","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2nd International Conference on System Reliability and Safety, ICSRS 2017","20 December 2017 through 22 December 2017","Milan","134455","","978-153863322-9","","","English","Int.

In this paper, we develop an integrated framework for condition-informed risk analysis. A conventional event tree model is used, in which some safety barriers are subject to degradation mechanisms and their failure probabilities are treated as time-dependent. Particle Filtering (PF) is used to update the failure probabilities of the safety barriers in real-time, based on the collected condition-monitoring data. The updated failure probabilities are, then, used in the event tree model. The developed framework also allows predicting the scenario probabilities in the future. To do this, the failure probabilities are updated and predicted by PF and, then integrated in the event tree.

In this paper, we develop a model based on the theory of aggregated stochastic processes to describe the history-dependent behavior and the effect of neglected failures on the Markov history-dependent repairable systems. Based on the developed model, instantaneous and steady-state availabilities are derived to characterize the reliability of the system. Four reliability-related time distributions, i.e., distribution for the k th working period, distribution for the k th failure period, distribution for the real working time in an effective working period, distribution for the neglected failure time in an effective working period, are also derived to provide a more comprehensive description of the system's reliability.

Lessons learnt from reliability engineering practices in civil aviation industry are given, which might serve as reference for reliability managers and engineers, also from other industries with high reliability requirements. © 2018 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics","Civil aviation; Commercial aircraft; Fault diagnosis and prognosis; Human reliability analysis; Maintenance; Quality control; Reliability design; Reliability engineering","Civil aviation; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Maintenance; Quality control; Commercial aircraft; Diagnosis and prognosis; Human reliability analysis; Reliability design; Reliability engineering; Reliability analysis","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61573043, 71601010, 71671009)","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61573043 , 71671009 and 71601010 ).

In real-life cases, engineers need to design an optimal MSSPS structure by combining different versions and number of redundant components. The objective of the design is to ensure reliability requirements using the least costs, which could be formulated as a redundancy optimization problem under reliability constraints. The genetic algorithm is one of the most frequently used method for solving redundancy optimization problems. In traditional genetic algorithms, the population size needs to be determined based on the experience of the modeler. Often, this ends up creating a large number of unnecessary samples. As a result, the computational burden can be huge, especially for large-scale MSSPS structures. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an optimal structure designing method named as redundancy ordinal optimization. The universal generating function technique is applied to evaluate the reliabilities of the MSSPSs. Based on the reliabilities, an ordinal optimization algorithm is adapted to update the parent populations and the stopping criterion of genetic algorithm, so that the unnecessary structure designs can be eliminated. Numerical examples show that the proposed method improves the computational efficiency while remaining satisfactorily accurate. © IMechE 2021.","genetic algorithm; multi-state series-parallel systems; ordinal optimization; Redundancy optimization; reliability assessment","Computational efficiency; Numerical methods; Population statistics; Redundancy; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Computational burden; Optimization problems; Ordinal optimization; Reliability constraints; Reliability requirements; Series-parallel system; Traditional genetic algorithms; Universal generating functions; Genetic algorithms","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71871200)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number 71871200).

Traditional deep learning methods face three major challenges, i.e., when the training dataset is limited, unbalanced, and/or when the model is applied in the different working conditions from the training dataset. In this article, we propose an improved deep learning-based fault diagnosis framework for EMAs based on triplet network with coupled cluster losses. Unlike the traditional approaches, the proposed framework learns to predict similarity between samples, rather than the fault labels directly. The trained model is used to calculate the distance between testing samples and a set of benchmark samples with known labels. Fault diagnosis is, then, conducted based on the $K$-nearest neighbor algorithm. Experiments on a real-world EMA dataset from NASA show that the developed framework can improve the performance of traditional deep learning-based approaches under the three challenges. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Domain difference; fault diagnosis; limited dataset; triplet network; unbalanced dataset","Deep learning; Electromechanical actuators; Electromechanical devices; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Mechanical actuators; NASA; Nearest neighbor search; Numerical methods; Deep learning; Domain differences; Employee welfare; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Limited dataset; Transfer learning; Triplet network; Unbalanced datasets; Personnel training","","","","","Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program, (2020YFH0022); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075349); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202106240078)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 52075349, in part by the Sichuan Science and Technology Program under Grant 2020YFH0022, and in part by the China Scholarship Council under Grant 202106240078.","Q.

Such assessment methods suffered from a lot of limitations. For example, it is in general difficult to collect enough life testing data to support an accurate reliability assessment. Further, the experimental conditions can hardly reproduce the way a consumer will use a product in practice. In the meantime, with the expansion of the Internet, a lot of customers give their feedbacks on the products by posting reviews on websites. This constitutes a huge, easily accessible, and more realistic database that can be used to assess reliability. In this work, we scraped reviews from a famous e-commerce website. Machine learning models are developed to extract failure-related information from these reviews. Two kinds of information are examined in this study: (1) whether a review reports a failure and, in such a case, (2) the severity of the failure. We used natural language processing tools to process text and we developed different classification models for information extraction. The developed methods were tested on customer review data from 11 different tablets of several brands. The results we obtained were around 85% accuracy when training and testing our models with our dataset. Hence, the machine learning-based approach we developed is demonstrated to be a promising first step to assess reliability thanks to web-based data. However, with a corpus containing only a few thousand reviews and more than 100,000 words, using text to train classification models remains a complicated task. Especially, the models developed in this paper strongly overfit despite the use of several methods designed to prevent overfitting. © ESREL 2021.

To achieve better performance, telecommunication networks adopt technologies such as NFV (Network Function Virtualization). However, this evolution also brings more potential risks to the telecommunication network. Reliability and resilience are becoming critical for service delivery in the networks. To answer to service requirements of high level availability and reliability, a model with a global view of infrastructure, virtual network elements, and network layer structure is required. Toward this end, this paper presents a Petri Net method to model 5G and beyond telecommunication networks. We introduce an extended Petri Net to model physical infrastructure, virtual infrastructure, network services, their behaviors, and dependencies. We present a simulation result on network availability estimation. This result shows the potential of the Petri Net-based model to be applied to a complex telecommunication system resilience assessment.  © 2022 IEEE.","5G networks; availability; B5G; modeling; Petri Net; resilience; simulation","Availability; Complex networks; Network function virtualization; Network layers; Petri nets; Queueing networks; B5G; Complex applications; Modeling; Network resilience; Performance; Potential risks; Resilience; Service delivery; Simulation; Telecommunications networks; 5G mobile communication systems","","","","","","","","Zhani M.F.; Limam N.; Borylo P.; Boubendir A.; dos Santos C.R.P.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Huawei; Nokia; Technology Innovation Institute (TII)","25th Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet and Networks, ICIN 2022","7 March 2022 through 10 March 2022","Virtual, Paris","178910","","978-172818688-7","","","English","Proc.

Most of the existing resilience quantification methods assume that the performance level of the system is continuous. A lot of practical energy systems, however, are multistate in nature or needs to be modeled by multistate models to control the modelling/computational complexity (Levitin, 2011). There are only a few works regarding quantifying resilience using multistate models. Thekdi and Chatterjee (2019) developed a multistate hidden Markov model to quantify resilience of infrastructure systems and discussed decision making based on the model. Nuss et al. (2017) used a continuous time discrete state Markov model to quantify the resilience against disruptions considering the multistate engineering system behaviors of unmanned surface vessels to support system design selection during trade studies. In a previous research of the authors (Du et al., 2019), a Markov reward process-based model is developed for quantifying resistant, absorption, recovery and overall resilience. All the above mentioned works are based on Markov (or hidden Markov) models. A significant drawback of these Markov model-based methods is that they have to assume that the transition times among states follow exponential distributions. Practical systems, however, exhibit a variety of time-dependent behaviors, which cannot be adequately described using only exponential distributions. In this paper, we develop a Semi-Markov reward process-based approach to quantify resilience of multistate systems, considering the time-dependent behaviors of both the pre-disruption protection processes and the post-disruption recovery processes. Four numerical metrics are defined to quantify resilience based on the developed model. The model is applied to analyze the resilience of a crude oil storage tank farm. © ESREL2020-PSAM15 Organizers.

The degradation processes are described by stochastic differential equations, whereas transitions between the system discrete states are triggered by random shocks. The modeling is, then, based on Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS), whose state space is comprised of a continuous state determined by stochastic differential equations and a discrete state driven by stochastic transitions and reset maps. A set of differential equations are derived to characterize the conditional moments of the state variables. System reliability and its lower bounds are estimated from these conditional moments, using the First Order Second Moment (FOSM) method and Markov inequality, respectively. The developed framework is applied to model three dependent failure processes from literature and a comparison is made to Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate that the developed framework is able to yield an accurate estimation of reliability with less computational costs compared to traditional Monte Carlo-based methods. © 2017 Fan et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.","","Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Models, Theoretical; Monte Carlo Method; Reproducibility of Results; Stochastic Processes; chemical binding; degradation; human; Monte Carlo method; reliability; stochastic model; algorithm; computer simulation; Markov chain; reproducibility; theoretical model","","","","","","","","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","28231313","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013638280"

When developing data-driven fault diagnosis models for EMA, training and testing data might come from different working conditions, reducing the generalization ability of traditional data-driven models. To address the challenge of domain difference between training and testing data, we propose a hybrid domain adaptation network, whose loss functions comprise of adversarial loss, triplet loss and cross-entropy loss. Adversarial loss and triplet loss can enhance the inter-domain and intra-class domain clustering, respectively. A softmax classifier with cross-entropy loss is used to predict pseudo labels for unlabeled target domain training samples. Compared to traditional transfer learning models that only reduces the global inter-domain difference between two domains, the strength of our model is that both the intra and inter-class domain difference are reduced. Curriculum pseudo labeling (CPL) is further applied to dynamically adjust thresholds for different classes during training phases. Compared to the fixed threshold in previous efforts, CPL can take into account the difference in pseudo label prediction and improve the performance of the developed model. The experiment results show that, compared to several transfer learning models, the developed model can achieve better classification accuracy in target domain. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Curriculum pseudo labeling; EMA fault diagnosis; Hybrid domain adaptation; Inter-domain clustering; Intra-class domain clustering","Ability testing; Electromechanical actuators; Electromechanical devices; Entropy; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Learning systems; Mechanical actuators; Actuator fault; Clusterings; Curriculum pseudo labeling; Domain adaptation; Electro-mechanical actuator fault diagnose; Faults diagnosis; Hybrid domain; Hybrid domain adaptation; Inter-domain; Inter-domain clustering; Intra class; Intra-class domain clustering; Labelings; Curricula","","","","","SNCF; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075349); Orange; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202106240078); Aeronautical Science Foundation of China, (201905019001); Electricité de France, EDF","The research of Anne Barros and Zhiguo Zeng are partially supported by the chaire of Risk and Resilience of Complex Systems (Chaire EDF, Orange and SNCF).

High impact low probability (HILP) events, such as natural hazards, manmade errors, and cyber-attacks, as well as the inherent fragility of the distribution grid have propelled the development of effective resilience tools and methods for the power distribution network (PDN) to avoid catastrophic infrastructural and economical losses. Multiple resilience evaluation frameworks are proposed in the literature in order to assist distribution system operators (DSOs) in managing their networks when faced with exogenous threats. We conduct detailed analysis of existing quantitative resilience studies in both electric and telecommunication domains of a PDN, focusing on event type, metrics, temporal phases, uncertainty, and critical load. Our work adopts the standpoint of a DSO, whose target is to identify feasible resilience assessment frameworks, which apply to pre-defined requirements in terms of resilience evaluation objectives (planning, reactive response, or simple assessment), time of evaluation, and available enhancement strategies. Finally, results and observations on selected works are presented, followed by discussion of identified challenges and opportunities. © 2021 by the authors.

The overall reliability is, then, derived based on the total probability theorem. A Bayesian network model is developed to explicitly compute the probability of unexpected failures.

The QRA trustworthiness is assumed to be determined by the quality of the QRA process. Six quality criteria, i.e., completeness of documentations, understanding of problem settings, coverage of accident scenarios, appropriateness of analysis methods, quality of input data, accuracy of risk calculation, are identified as the factors most influencing the trustworthiness. The assessment is, then, formulated as a classification problem, solved by a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) constructed based on a set of training data, whose trustworthiness is given by experts. NBC learns the expert's assessment from the training data: therefore, once constructed, the NBC can be used to assess the trustworthiness of QRAs other than the training data. Leave-one-out cross validation is applied to validate the accuracy of the developed classifier. A stochastic hypothesis testing-based approach is also developed to check the consistency of the training data. The performance of the developed methods is tested for ten artificially generated scenarios. The results demonstrate that the developed framework is able to accurately mimic a variety of expert behaviors in assessing the trustworthiness of QRA. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Naive Bayes classifer; Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA); Reliability; Trustworthiness; Validity","Classification (of information); Classifiers; Quality control; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Statistical methods; Stochastic systems; Classification based methods; Hypothesis testing; Leave-one-out cross validations; Naive bayes; Naive Bayes classifiers; Quantitative risk analysis; Trustworthiness; Validity; analytic method; Article; classification; conceptual framework; documentation; measurement accuracy; priority journal; quality control; quantitative analysis; quantitative risk analysis; trustworthiness assessment; Risk assessment","","","","","","","","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09257535","","SSCIE","","English","Saf.

Unlike the existing methods, the developed method models the root cause of the dependency explicitly, so that a deterministic model, rather than a probabilistic one, can be established. Three steps comprise the developed method. First, physics-of-failure (PoF) models are utilized to model each failure mechanism. Then, interactions among failure mechanisms are modeled as a combination of three basic relations, competition, superposition and coupling. This is the reason why the method is referred to as “compositional method”. Finally, the PoF models and the interaction model are combined to develop a deterministic model of the dependent failure behavior. As a demonstration, the method is applied on an actual spool and the developed failure behavior model is validated by a wear test. The result demonstrates that the compositional method is an effective way to model dependent failure behavior. © 2017 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics","Degradation; Dependent failures; Multiple dependent competing failure processes; Reliability modeling; Shock","Aerodynamics; Degradation; Mechanical engineering; Competing failure; Compositional method; Dependent failure; Deterministic modeling; Failure behaviors; Physics of failures; Reliability model; Shock; Failure (mechanical)","","","","","Center for Produce Safety; National Natural Science Foundation of China, (51675025, 61573043, 71671009); Beihang University"," This work has been performed within the initiative of the Center for Resilience and Safety of Critical Infrastructures (CRESCI, http://cresci.cn ).

Most of the existing works on selective maintenance assumed that after each mission, the components’ states can be precisely known without additional efforts. In engineering scenarios, the states of the components in a system need to be revealed by inspections that are usually inaccurate. Inspection activities also consume the limited resources shared with maintenance activities. We, thus, put forth a novel decision framework for selective maintenance of partially observable systems with which maintenance and inspection activities will be scheduled in a holistic and interactively sequential manner. As the components’ states are partially observable and the remaining resources are fully observable, we formulate a finite-horizon Mixed Observability Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) model to support the optimization. In the MOMDP model, both maintenance and inspection actions can be interactively and sequentially planned based on the distributions of components’ states and the remaining resources. To improve the solution efficiency of the MOMDP model, we customize a Deep Value Network (DVN) algorithm in which the maximum mission success probability is approximated. A five-component system and a real-world multi-state coal transportation system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is shown that the probability of the system successfully completing the next mission can be significantly increased by taking inspections into account. The results also demonstrate the computational efficiency of the customized DVN algorithm. © Copyright © 2022 “IISE”.","deep reinforcement learning; deep value network; inspection strategy; interactively sequential decision; partially observable systems; Selective maintenance","Computational efficiency; Condition based maintenance; Deep learning; Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; Deep reinforcement learning; Deep value network; Inspection strategy; Interactively sequential decision; Maintenance and inspections; Partially observable systems; Reinforcement learnings; Selective maintenance; Sequential decisions; Value network; Inspection","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71922006)","The authors acknowledge the grant support received from the National Natural Science Fundation of China under contract number 71922006.

These novel applications, on the other hand, bring new challenges to network resilience. Among them, traffic variation is one of the most vital threats to the 5G network. With tens of thousands of devices connected to the network, network service resilience is threatened by the heavy traffic change induced by the end users or malicious attacks. While long timescale traffic variation can be easily predicted based on historical data, short timescale abnormal traffic is hard to forecast yet can significantly violate the service requirements. The impact of short timescale traffic variation can be mitigated by 5G management and control systems. However, the complexity and dynamics of the virtualized 5G system make it hard to estimate its resilience. This paper provides a 5G network model that captures the data traffic changes and network dynamic management mechanism. The model is able to evaluate the performance of different network services with different requirements under traffic variation events. We analyze the effectiveness of auto-scaling and compare different isolation strategies for traffic congestion. The simulation results on service resilience estimation can become strong supporting information for 5G network deployment and configuration.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","5G; auto-scaling; communication networks; discrete event simulation; Kubernetes; network resilience; network service; Petri Net; traffic variation; virtual networks","Analytical models; Costs; Discrete event simulation; Information management; Petri nets; Queueing networks; Reliability; Traffic congestion; 5g; 5g mobile communication; Auto-scaling; Communications networks; Discrete-event simulations; Kubernetes; Mobile communications; Network resilience; Networks services; Resilience; Resource management; Scalings; Traffic variation; Virtual networks; 5G mobile communication systems","","","","","","","R.

Most existing CCF models assume that the component failure behavior does not vary over time. Such an assumption is often challenged in practice due to the influence of various degradation mechanisms, e.g., wear, corrosion, fatigue, etc. In this paper, we develop a new model for CCFs considering components degradation. The model is developed in the mathematical framework of Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS). The CCFs are modeled as random shock processes that affect a group of components simultaneously and the components degradation processes are modeled by stochastic differential equations derived from physics-of-failures. The benefit of using the SHS model for CCFs is that the developed model is analytically solvable. The system reliability can, then, also be solved analytically in closed form. The proposed CCF modelling framework is demonstrated by a numerical example of a three-unit redundant system and, then, applied to an Auxiliary Feedwater Pump (AFP) system of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). A comparison to the Binomial Failure Rate (BFR) model of literature shows that by considering the components degradation processes, the proposed model can accurately describe the CCF effect on the reliability of a system with degrading components. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Binomial failure rate model; Common-cause failures; Component degradation; Monte Carlo simulation; Random shocks; Stochastic hybrid systems","Bins; Degradation; Differential equations; Failure analysis; Feedwater pumps; Hybrid systems; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Outages; Reliability; Safety engineering; Solar buildings; Stochastic systems; Systems analysis; Common cause failure; Component degradation; Failure rate modeling; Random shocks; Stochastic hybrid systems; Stochastic models","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61573043, 71671009); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201606020082)","This work has been performed within the initiative of the Center for Resilience and Safety of Critical Infrastructures (CRESCI, http://cresci.cn ).

A hierarchical framework is first developed for evaluating the trustworthiness of the risk assessment. The evaluation is based on two main attributes (criteria), i.e., the strength of knowledge supporting the assessment and the fidelity of the risk assessment model. These two attributes are further broken down into sub-attributes and, finally, leaf attributes. The trustworthiness is calculated using a weighted average of the leaf attributes, in which the weights are calculated using the Dempster Shafer Theory-Analytical Hierarchy Process (DST-AHP). Risk aggregation is, then, performed by a “weighted posterior” method, considering the level of trustworthiness. An application to the risk aggregation of two hazard groups in Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) is illustrated. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Multi-hazards risk aggregation (MHRA); Nuclear power plants (NPP); Quantitative risk assessment (QRA); Risk-informed decision making; Strength of knowledge (SoK); Trustworthiness in risk assessment","Decision making; Hazards; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Dempster-Shafer theory; Quantitative risk assessment; Risk aggregations; Risk assessment models; Risk-informed decision making; Strength of knowledge (SoK); Weighted averages; article; decision making; nuclear power plant; plant leaf; risk assessment; Risk assessment","","","","","","","E.

Business Continuity Management (BCM) is a way to integrate the recovery process within the preventive framework of risk assessment. Such integrated risk management strategy offers great potential benefits. However, the complexity of applying it in practice is such that existing BCM strategies are mainly based on qualitative methods only, which limits the potential added values. To support quantitative BCM, in this paper we define a set of quantitative business continuity metrics. The defined metrics are based on the estimated losses incurred by the disruptive event in the whole business process. For this, the business process is divided into four sequential phases, i.e., protection phase, mitigation phase, emergency phase and recovery phase. For each phase, a specific modeling method is developed and an integrated modeling framework is constructed for the business continuity. Simulation can, then, be used to quantify the business continuity metrics. The developed methods are applied to assess the business continuity of an oil storage tank farm. © 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Business continuity management; Event consequence diagram; Event tree; Oil storage tank farm; Risk analysis; Semi-Markovian model","Disasters; Markov processes; Risk analysis; Risk management; Tanks (containers); Uncertainty analysis; Business continuity management; Event consequence diagram; Event trees; Oil storage tank; Semi-Markovian models; Risk assessment","","","","","","","E.

Grid control is even more critical during extreme events as the WAC function is required to orchestrate the response to contingencies and enhance the power system resilience through failure localization, isolation, and service restoration. Both power and telecommunication domains are involved in control applications, giving rise to multiple cyber-physical interdependencies. This paper proposes a resilience-based optimization of the distribution service restoration (DSR) by coordinating strategies of crew dispatch and manual/remote switches operation. The telecommunication service and underlying infrastructure are identified as main enablers of the co-optimization as all considered resilience strategies communicate with the control center that collects crisis management information. Therefore, the availability of telecom points in terms of power supply is examined in this work. Failure propagation in the coupled power-telecom network is highlighted, and differences in failure propagation between overhead and underground power lines are explored. The proposed approach is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, evaluated under a multi-feeder interdependent power-telecom test network. Results show that combined scheduling of resilience strategies as well as prioritization of power supply to telecom points-of-interest, yield an enhanced recovery strategy.

MDCFPs have been well studied in literature and various models have been developed to predict the reliability of MDCFPs. In practice, however, due to the limited resource, it is often hard to estimate the precise values of the parameters in the MDCFP model. Hence, the predicted reliability is affected by epistemic uncertainty. Probability box (P-box) is applied in this paper to describe the effect of epistemic uncertainty on MDCFP models. A dimension-reduced sequential quadratic programming (DRSQP) method is developed for the construction of P-box. A comparison to the conventional construction method shows that DRSQP method reduces the computational costs required for P-box constructions. Since epistemic uncertainty reflects the unsureness in the predicted reliability, a decision maker might want to reduce it by investing resource to more accurately estimate the value of each model parameter. A two-stage optimization framework is developed to allocate the resource among the parameters and ensure that epistemic uncertainty is reduced in a most efficient way. Finally, the developed methods are applied on a real case study, a spool valve, to demonstrate their validity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Epistemic uncertainty; Multiple dependent competing failure process; Reliability box; Reliability modeling; SQP method","Decision making; Quadratic programming; Reliability; Competing failure; Conventional constructions; Engineering components; Epistemic uncertainties; Reduced sequential quadratic programming; Reliability model; SQP method; Two stage optimizations; Uncertainty analysis","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, (61573043)","This work has been performed within the initiative of the Center for Resilience and Safety of Critical Infrastructures (CRESCI, http://cresci.cn).

The resulting papers are first analyzed through a meta-data and bibliometric analysis, in which the trend of publication growth, important publication sources and authors, collaboration among the authors are identified. The evolution of research topics in three time periods (prior to mid-1990s, mid-1990s - 2010 and 2010 - present) is also discussed through a semantic clustering. Then, the most important papers from the literature search are chosen for a content analysis and critical review. The main results of the critical literature review include: First, we summarize the dependent failure behavior in different system hierarchies, i.e., failure mechanism level, component level, system level and systems-of-systems level. In each level, the main dependent failure behavior from literature is discussed with examples. Second, we develop a classification framework for the dependent failure behavior models. The most frequently-used models in each category are critically reviewed, based on which we identify five challenging problems the current dependency models face, give our perspectives on their possible solutions, and discuss future research opportunities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Dependent failure behavior; Reliability; Risk","Failure (mechanical); Semantics; Behaviour models; Bibliometrics analysis; Dependent failure; Dependent failure behavior; Failure behaviors; Literature reviews; Literature search; Research topics; System levels; Time-periods; Reliability","","","","","SNCF; Orange; Université Paris-Saclay; Electricité de France, EDF","The research of Zhiguo Zeng is financially supported by ANR, France under grant number ANR-22-CE10-0004 .

In this paper, we consider resilience modeling and analysis for multi-state systems, whose performances are characterized by discrete, rather than continuous variables. A non-homogeneous Semi-Markov reward process model is developed for resilience analysis of multi-state systems. In the developed model, system performance changes, caused by either disruptive events or system recoveries, are modeled as state transitions, and rewards are used to model financial losses incurred during and after the disruptions. Four resilience metrics are defined to quantify different aspects of resilience. As the developed model is non-homogeneous, it can capture time-dependent system behaviors and their impact on system resilience. An efficient resilience analysis algorithm is also designed based on linear interpolation and implemented using vectorization. The computational benefits of the developed algorithm are demonstrated through two numerical experiments. We apply the developed method on two practical case studies, an oil tank farm and a re-configurable computing system. The results show that the developed methods can quantify resilience of multi-state systems accurately and efficiently. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Accumulated reward; Extreme events; Multi-state system; Non-homogeneous semi-Markov process; Resilience","Losses; Oil tanks; Analysis algorithms; Continuous variables; Linear Interpolation; Multi-state system; Numerical experiments; Reconfigurable computing; Resilience metrics; Time dependent behavior; Uncertainty analysis","","","","","High-end Foreign Experts Recruitment Program of Shanghai university; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71601010); Recruitment Program of Global Experts","Funding text 1: The authors would like express their deepest gratitude to the associate editor, domain editor, and two anonymous reviewers, for their insightful comments and suggestions that help to significantly improve this paper.

Modeling of such systems are widely researched in recent years. In this paper, we adopt a new approach to model DCFP based on a class of stochastic processes referred to as stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) to achieve better computational performance. The developed SHS-based DCFP model considers soft failures caused jointly by continuous degradation and additional abrupt degradation increment due to random shocks, and hard failures caused by sudden overload from the same shock processes. Failures occur whenever one of the following two events happens: (i) the degradation process reaches its threshold; (ii) a shock whose magnitude exceeds a critical strength level occurs. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","","Computation theory; Hybrid systems; Random processes; Reliability; Reliability theory; Safety engineering; Solar buildings; Stochastic models; Competing failure; Computational performance; Continuous degradations; Critical strength; Degradation process; New approaches; Random shocks; Stochastic hybrid systems; Stochastic systems","","","","","","","","Walls L.; Revie M.; Bedford T.","CRC Press/Balkema","European Safety and Reliability Association; UK Safety and Reliability Society; University of Strathclyde, Scotland","26th European Safety and Reliability Conference, ESREL 2016","25 September 2016 through 29 September 2016","Glasgow","181029","","978-113802997-2","","","English","Risk, Reliab.

In the developed method, Markov models are used to describe the time-dependent (failure/repair) behaviors of the power generation components. Multi-valued decision diagrams (MDD) are developed to model the generation capacity of each component. The capacity of the DG system is, then, calculated as a summation of the power generated by all the components. A MDD-based reliability evaluation algorithm is developed to calculate two reliability indexes for the DG system, i.e., Expected Energy Not Supplied (EENS) and Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE). A comparison to existing time-dependent reliability methods shows that the developed method can achieve more accurate results while requiring far less computational costs. Also, a comparison to the static reliability analysis methods shows that the developed method can better estimate the reliability indexes, especially at the early stage of the life cycle. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","","Distributed power generation; Life cycle; Loss of load probability; Many valued logics; Markov processes; Reliability theory; Distributed generation system; Expected energy not supplied; Generation capacity; Loss of load expectation; Multi-valued decision diagrams; Power Generation Components; Reliability evaluation algorithm; Time dependent reliability; Reliability analysis","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61573043, 71601010); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2016M590030)","This work has been performed within the initiative of the Center for Resilience and Safety of Critical Infrastructures (CRESCI, http://cresci.cn).

Critical infrastructures are often interdependent on each other, and the topology of the interdependencies between different systems, also referred to as coupling interface, plays a key role in terms of their resilience against failures. In case of failures due to natural events, random disturbances, or deliberate attacks, the design of the coupling interface is a key factor for maintaining high performance within the interdependent CIs. However, in the existing literature, the issue of the coupling interface design is often addressed through heuristics. In this work, we propose an optimization-based mathematical approach for designing coupling interfaces between interdependent critical infrastructures under random failures. The proposed approach allows designing a coupling interface that is robust against the worst realization of a set of feasible failure scenarios. Using as case study interdependent power and gas networks, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing solutions based on network metrics-based heuristics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Coupling interface; Defender–attacker–defender; Interdependent critical infrastructures; Optimization; Resilience","Critical infrastructures; Heuristic methods; Public works; Coupling interfaces; Defender–attacker–defender; Economic stability; Interdependent critical infrastructure; Key factors; Natural events; Optimisations; Random disturbances; Resilience; Socio-economics; Optimization","","","","","","","A.

Finding an optimal protection plan often takes the form of a multilevel optimization problem. Recently, approaches based on distributionally robust optimization (DRO) have gained the attention of many scholars. In fact, DRO allows protecting the decision-maker from the ambiguity arising from the imprecisely identified probability distributions of the failure scenarios. In this framework, the probability distribution of the failure scenarios is assumed to be known ambiguously, and contained in an ambiguity set defined by moment-based conditions. In practice, some decisions taken in the protection plan affect the conditions of the ambiguity set. We refer to this situation as DRO with endogenous uncertainty. In this paper, we study the impact of the endogenous uncertainty on the optimal protection plan of a power network, using a numerical example built upon the IEEE 14-bus system with a traditional moment-based ambiguity set.

To address this issue, we develop a dynamic risk assessment (DRA) method that allows online estimation of risk indexes using data collected during operation. Two types of data are considered: statistical failure data, which refer to the counts of accidents or near misses from similar systems and condition-monitoring data, which come from online monitoring the degradation of the target system of interest. For this, a hierarchical Bayesian model is developed to compute the reliability of the safety barriers and a Bayesian updating algorithm, which integrates particle filtering (PF) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo, is developed to update the reliability evaluations based on both the statistical and condition-monitoring data. The updated safety barriers reliabilities, are, then, used in an event tree (ET) for consequence analysis and the risk indexes are updated accordingly. A case study on a high-flow safety system is conducted to demonstrate the developed methods. A comparison to the DRA method which only uses statistical failure data shows that by introducing condition-monitoring data on the system degradation process, it is possible to capture the system-specific characteristics, and, therefore, provide a more complete and accurate description of the risk of the target system. © 2018 IEEE.","Condition-monitoring; dynamic risk assessment (DRA); event tree (ET) analysis; hierarchical Bayesian model; Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC); particle filtering (PF)","Accident prevention; Accidents; Barium compounds; Bayesian networks; Chains; Condition monitoring; Degradation; Markov processes; Monte Carlo methods; Online systems; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Risk management; Risk perception; Bayes method; Dynamic risk assessments; Event trees; Hierarchical Bayesian modeling; Indexes; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Particle Filtering; Risk assessment","","","","","","","E.

The prediction capability heavily influences the decision makers' attitude toward taking the risk of using the predicted remaining useful life to inform the maintenance decisions. In this article, a four-layer, top-down, hierarchical decision-making framework is proposed to assess the prediction capability of prognostic methods. In the framework, prediction capability is broken down into two criteria (Layer 2), six sub-criteria (Layer 3) and 19 basic sub-criteria (Layer 4). Based on the hierarchical framework, a bottom-up, quantitative approach is developed for the assessment of the prediction capability, using the information and data collected at the Layer-4 basic sub-criteria level. Analytical hierarchical process is applied for the evaluation and aggregation of the sub-criteria and support vector machine is applied to develop a classification-based approach for prediction capability assessment. The framework and quantitative approach are applied on a simulated case study to assess the prediction capabilities of three prognostic methods of the literature: fuzzy similarity, feed-forward neural network and hidden semi-Markov model. The results show the feasibility of the practical application of the framework and its quantitative assessment approach, and that the assessed prediction capability can be used to support the selection of the suitable prognostic method for a given application. © IMechE 2016.","analytical hierarchical process; feed-forward neural network; fuzzy similarity; hidden semi-Markov model; prediction capability; Prognostic and health management; remaining useful life","Classification (of information); Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Markov processes; Analytical hierarchical process; Fuzzy similarity; Hidden semi-Markov modeling; Prediction capability; Prognostic and health management; Remaining useful lives; Decision making","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, (61573043, 71671009)","The research of Prof. Rui Kang is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61573043 and No. 71671009).","E.

These systems are usually modeled as multiperformance multistate systems (MPMSSs). However, existing MPMSS models fail to consider an important aspect, i.e., the performance conversion process. For example, in a combined heat and power (CHP) generating unit, apart from the output heat and electricity, decision-makers are also interested in the unit's capacity to convert gas into electricity and heat. The latter is related to the performance conversion process. This article proposes a framework for the reliability evaluation of performance conversion-based MPMSS. In the proposed MPMSS model, the couplings among different types of performances inside the components are quantified into the multistate performance conversion matrix. The performance conversion structure functions are proposed to derive system performance conversion capability based on the conversion capabilities of the components. Two reliability evaluation methods considering the steady-state performance conversion process and the continuous-time performance conversion process are proposed, respectively. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the developed methods.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Multiperformance multistate system (MPMSSs); Multistate system; Performance conversion process; Reliability; Universal generating function (UGF)","Continuous time systems; Decision making; Numerical methods; Combined heat and power; Conversion process; Heat and electricity; Multi-state system; Multiple performance measures; Reliability Evaluation; Steady state performance; Structure functions; Reliability analysis","","","","","NSFC-JPI UE, (71961137004); Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe, JPI UE; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71871200)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71871200 and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation China and Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe Call (NSFC-JPI UE) under Grant 71961137004","Y.

Best judgment and optimistic assumptions may result in failing to meet the quantitative safety objectives, whereas conservative assumptions may increase the margins which the objectives are met with but result in cost-ineffective design or operation. In the present paper, we develop an extended framework for the analysis of the criticality of assumptions in risk assessment by evaluating the risk that deviations from the assumptions lead to a reduction of the safety margins. The framework aims to support risk-informed decision making by identifying important assumptions and integrating the assessment of their criticality into the quantitative risk assessment (QRA). The framework is, finally applied within the quantitative risk assessment of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) exposed to external flooding. Compared to previous works on the subject, we consider also conservative assumptions and introduce decision flow diagrams to support the classification of the criticality of the assumptions. The framework provides a more comprehensive and transparent evaluation of the assumptions deviation risk through the decision flow diagrams that facilitate the standardization of the evaluation of the assumption deviation effects on the risk assessment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Assumption deviation; Conservative assumption; Decision flow diagram; External flooding; Nuclear power plants; Quantitative risk assessment; Strength of knowledge","Criticality (nuclear fission); Floods; Flowcharting; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Exposed to; Flow diagram; ITS applications; Quantitative risk assessment; Risk-informed decision making; Safety margin; Safety objectives; Risk assessment","","","","","","","E.
